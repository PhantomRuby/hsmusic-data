    The original version of Spelunky, developed by Derek Yu and now dubbed [<i>Spelunky Classic</i>](https://spelunkyworld.com/original.html), released on December 21st, 2008 on TIGSource. Although it was later remastered, that Game Maker version remains freeware.
    Spelunky Classic's retro-style, fondly-remembered soundtrack was composed by [[artist:buzinkai]] and [[artist:jon-perry]], the former of whom only a year or so later composed renowned tracks of the Homestuck discography [[Doctor]], [[Explore]], [[Endless Climb]] and more; Jon Perry has been designing hands-on and video games alike for many years, including other collaborations with Derek Yu.

    I was reckoning with my body, my sex, and a maze of painful entanglements that made me feel like a lost monster. If that sounds familiar at all, then listen for the beat of LABYRINTH'S HEART.

    making my discography available again, starting with this one~

Lyrics: |-
    (Countless bodies remain unidentified, some ending up in unmarked graves and small border town cemeteries.)

    (I went out on a forensic case, and the sheriff had a skull on his office desk. It was the skull of a younger person, and he was using it as a pencil holder. He had pens and pencils in the eye socket of this person. So that's when I decided something had to be done.)

Sampled Tracks:
- both samples are originally from Norman Cook (aka Fatboy Slim)'s seminal 'Skip To My Loops' sample cd which is of course wholly plagiarized from various sources but that's samples for you oh well anyways the samples are then used in Sonic 3's miniboss/act 1 boss music and the specific compression used to put those clips into the Genesis is instantly recognizable here (although Come on! also appears in JSR and Sonic Rush)

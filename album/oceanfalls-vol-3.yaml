Commentary: |-
    <i>Mathias Ramalho:</i>
    ([SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/friendly-coy/ytu-rendy))
    Track's name means "Light from the Waterfalls" in GuaranÃ­. Ytu comes from "y" which is water, it means waterfall. Rendy refers turning on or light in this context. You can also be a funnyman and use the other meaning of Rendy which is saliva, pretty much what I intended "accidentally" lmao.

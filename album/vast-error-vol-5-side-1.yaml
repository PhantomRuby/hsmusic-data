    <i>Rainy:</i> ([YouTube description](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Mw_rHk3Av0), excerpt)

    This song is a bit of a special one since it was my first Vast Error song I wrote when I joined the team. I had actually written the main riff a few months prior to joining the team but never really got around to making a finished song with it. When I was retooling it for Vol.5, I decided to take an entirely different approach then I had previously. I was listening to a lot of Daft Punk at the time and I decided to rewrite the song in the vein of the song [[track:aerodynamic-daft-punk|“Aerodynamic.”]] Just like that song, DEAD 2 RIGHTS is built around a processed, resampled guitar riffs that I took from the original demo and dance beats like 909s and Amen Breaks. In addition, I played around with repetition by having certain elements drop in and out throughout the track. It was a bit out of my wheel house but I think the final product was good.

    To fall in love

Commentary: |-
    <i>Rainy:</i> ([YouTube description](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKqRYTXaLiQ), excerpt)

    Okay so. this song had a bit of a troubled development. For various reasons, this song went through like 3-4 different iterations before it became the song you’re hearing now. More so, this final version of the song was almost completely written 48 hours before the album came out. Despite all of that however, Torchlight probably one of my favorite songs I’ve ever written at up to this point. In terms of inspiration for this track, I took influence from the songs [[track:softly|“Softly”]] and [[track:stellarum-salve|“Stellarum Salve”]] by RJ Lake. In addition, I also drew inspiration from the song [“Shanghai”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-01sgnVgkRc) by King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard. I wanted this song to be bright, saccharine and little cute like those songs I mentioned previously because I felt that vibe fit Jentha perfectly. I’m pretty proud of this one not just because of how I was able to write this in such a short period of time but also because the song gave me an avenue to experiment with synthpop production for the first time. For that I will probably always love this song despite the issues.

Lyrics: |-
    Three, two, two, ugh

    Listen up y'all, the apathy ain't post-ironic
    Turkin's TV beats handmade by plundering phonics

    'Arcalicious: definition, making Taz go loco'
    She wonders where the old me went, can't see him in my photos
    Always leaving or just staying
    Couldn't care less what she's saying
    Want one reason why I keep her?
    The resonance is a feature

    I'm Arcalicious
    Soulmates stuck on the waitlist
    And if you scour probabilities?
    That shit is fictitious
    My tongue strikes wicked (Blaugh)
    Can't say I find this very fun
    But there's a line down to the stronghold for a chance to be the one
    Real insipid (Cigarette sweet)
    Real insipid (Corporate cornsyrup prodigy)
    Real insipid (Even Kerian can't keep his mind off me)
    I'm Arcalicious (C-Code Red gets 'em thirsty, thirsty)

    Arcalicious def-
    Karkalicious def-
    Goddammit-
    Um, White Noise? Keep The Hyperthetical on track-

    'Arcalicious: definition, makes Filler go crazy'
    I just took Laivan's breath away, birthday boy, he's panting
    I'm A to the R, C, J, the E, the C
    And every lousy post you make online better untag me

    I'm Arcalicious (Real insipid)
    My body stays vicious
    Mirthamaniacs nervous at my "possum"-style fitness
    Coliad's my witness (What)
    I'll open up his third eye
    And he'll need samples of my blood 'cause I want to fucking die
    Real insipid (Cigarette sweet)
    Real insipid (Corporate cornsyrup prodigy)
    Real insipid (Even Secily couldn't keep away from me)
    I'm Arcalicious (Now all you wiseass fools hold up, check it out)

    Grubby, grubby, grubby
    If you really want me
    Honey get some soul
    Maybe then you'll find your place
    I'll be lazy, lazy
    Don't replace me, -place me
    Just don't leave me, leave me
    These lyrics drive me crazy
    T to the a, to the s-t-e-y - that's "tasst-ee", t to the a to the s-t-e-y - that's "tasst-ee"
    D to the e, to the l-i-c-i-o-u-s, to the d, to the e, to the, to the–

    Let me lay it down
    All the time I turn around the gang gathers 'round, always asking why a younger me is stuck inside my head
    I don't wanna say it now, I really ain't tryin' to weasel out of this but truth is neither of us even know
    And I guess I just don't know how to tell you all about it, even though I keep repeating that I should be left alone
    But what I'm trying to say, is something I don't know how to say…

    'Taz just screamed that:'
    I'm insipid (So insipid)
    Soulmates stuck on the waitlist
    And if you scour probabilities?
    That shit is fictitious
    My tongue strikes wicked (Blaugh)
    Can't say I find this very fun
    But there's a line down the stronghold for a chance to be the one
    My body stays vicious
    Coliad's been getting nervous knowing this is just business
    Serpaz's my witness
    Bet she knows how to make this fun
    Just watch her be first in line for a chance to be the one

    So insipid (Calder you see)
    So insipid (You're not like me)
    So insipid (I'll help you be)
    I'm Arcalicious (C-Code Red gets 'em thirsty, thirsty)
    I'm insipid (ay, ay, ay, ay) [No, no really, I'm not that great]
    I'm insipid (ay, ay, ay, ay) [Seriously, why the fuck is this still going on?!]
    So insipid (ay, ay, ay, ay) [Who WANTED this?! Oh god, I can feel it coming again!]
    I'm Arcalicious (she says I make her thirsty, thirsty)

    T to the a, to the s-t-e-y - that's "tasst-ee", t to the a to the s-t-e-y - that's "tasst-ee"
    D to the e, to the l-i-c-i-o-u-s, to the d, to the e, to the l-i-c-i-o-u-s
    T to the a, to the s-t-e-y - that's "tasst-ee". T to the a, to the, to the, to the
    To the d to the e, to the l-i-c-i-o-u-s
    To the d, to the e, to the l-i-c-i-o-u-s
    To the d, to the e, to the l-i-c-i-o-u-s
    To the d, to the e, to the– SWEET ALL-MOTHER MAKE IT FUCKING STOP!

    I don't know who's idea of a cruel, sick joke it was to make me do this parody of a parody like my life depended on it. But congrats! You got your ugly, insufferable wish!!
    I sure as fuck didn't agree to it! But it's all yours, now and forever so long as there is someone so outlandishly cringeworthy stumbling their bad taste to the end of this travesty.
    Whoever you are, this is the rotten fruit of your labor, and I hope you're happy!
    Oh– oh GOD– it's happening again!

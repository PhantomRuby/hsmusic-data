    <i>Clark Powell:</i> ([Tumblr](https://plazmataz.tumblr.com/post/77117466480/its-been-a-long-time-since-cascade-homestuck), 2/18/2014)
    
    It's been a long time since [[Cascade]], Homestuck. But now that this is finally finished, it's time to release the new [[Flare]] remix!

    This song has almost every musical element of the original Flare sampled and used in a new way, along with lots of new additions and a gritty EDM style of production. I wrote the original song a long time ago, and since then I've grown dissatisfied with it in some ways. How better to improve on it than with a remix?

    For track art I talked to my girlfriend [[artist:andarix]], who has been doing crest design commission lately. She made one for me featuring the Green Sun and the chain of Derse for me, and I don't think it could have turned out more awesomely!

    I'm afraid you can't buy or download this song yet, but it will definitely be available on the next official Homestuck album release.

    And I want to give a special thanks to my patrons on [Patreon](http://www.patreon.com/plazmataz). Without you guys, I would have never have had the resources to make this remix!

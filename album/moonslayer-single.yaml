   Happy 4/13. Homestuck is getting old. I'm getting old, too. I will graduate from college and turn 22 this year. But my love of music, especially of music from Homestuck, will never get old. So here's a fun little remix of Toby Fox's "Moonsetter." Copious amounts of virtual distorted electric guitar, jazz piano, and intense rock drumming included. Enjoy.

   For some blabbery on how I arrived at the name "Moonslayer," check out [[track:moonslayer-lofam5a2|the extended description.]]

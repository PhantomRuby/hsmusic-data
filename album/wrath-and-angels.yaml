    A new year, but I'm not done yet. I've started doing [Weeklybeats 2014](https://weeklybeats.com/music?s=&f=8&y=2014&r=501) alongside this, though I've been using my ukulele for that. There's none of that here, all digitally made and looping.

    It's like the [pyramid song](https://youtu.be/3M_Gg1xAHE4), 4 times 3/4 followed by a 4/4.

    Angels=choir+harp, vengeance=minor chords. Like most songs here, it loops.

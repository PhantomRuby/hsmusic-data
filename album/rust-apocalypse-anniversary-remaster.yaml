    <i>Willow Ascenzo:</i>

    A remastered version of [[Rust Apocalypse]], released on the anniversary of the original track, which was itself an arrangement and expansion of [[track:rust-servant|a track I composed]] for the Homestuck album [[album:coloUrs-and-mayhem-universe-a]]. This version has been remastered from the original stem tracks for a brighter, clearer sound, and parts of the choir have been redone for additional clarity.

    I said I wouldn't have any new music to ring in the new year with, and that's still true, but I listened to [[Rust Apocalypse]] and realized that with my growth in skills and technological advances over the past year I could make the track sound so much clearer and richer than the original release! Marvel at actually hearing more intelligible words in the opening!

    It's only the one track, and it's name-your-price (to be fair to people who bought the [[album:rust-apocalypse|EP]] last year) but you can pay more for it if you want.

Lyrics: |-
    Fell in love with the girl
    With the ash in her eyes
    Of the weight of the world
    And her government ties

    Well I'm down on my knees
    And I'm kissing her calves
    In the land of the free
    Because she's all that I have

    Bombs away
    Look out below
    Ready or not
    We're ready to go
    Oh-oh-oh!

    Bombs away
    Look out below
    Ready or not
    We're ready to go

    Fell apart at the touch
    Of the girl in the jet
    She was pulling the clutch
    I was breaking a sweat

    Well she painted my face
    With the blood on her heels
    I could not walk away
    Because it's all that I feel

    Bombs away
    Look out below
    Ready or not
    We're ready to go
    (We're ready to go) Oh-oh-oh!

    Bombs away
    Look out below
    Ready or not
    We're ready to go

    Bombs away (Bombs away)
    Look out below (Look out below)
    Ready or not (Ready or not)
    We're ready to go (We're ready to go)

    Fell into the abyss
    And I never got out
    She was blowing a kiss
    I dissolved in a cloud

    At the top of the hill
    With the plane in the sky
    When she went for the kill
    I was ready to die

    Bombs away
    Look out below
    Ready or not
    We're ready to go
    Oh-oh-oh!

    Bombs away
    Look out below
    Ready or not
    We're ready to go

    Bombs away
    Look out below
    Ready or not
    We're ready to go
    We're ready to go!

    Bombs away
    Look out below
    Ready or not
    We're ready to go

Lyrics: |-
    Stand back, I'm a criminal mind
    I keep running, and I feel just fine
    Don't stop when they're reading my rights
    You won't see me when you turn on the lights

    I'm always moving, 'cause the city's so restless
    I keep my eyes open when I'm asleep
    I only take what can fit in my pockets
    I drop it all if I feel the heat

    Ooh, it's a slippery road
    Where the people are liquid and ice
    Ooh, it's a poisonous world
    Where the pleasures all come at a price

    Stand back, I'm a criminal mind
    I keep running, and I feel just fine
    Don't stop when they're reading my rights
    You won't see me when you turn on the lights

    I walk tall, but I keep a small footprint
    I never call from a telephone twice (Hello?)
    I keep a stash in every city I've been in
    I'll take a trip if the weather is nice

    Ooh, it's the sweat from your hands on the dial
    When you're cracking the safe
    Ooh, it's the part of the plan where you walk
    And you don't leave a trace

    Stand back, I'm a criminal mind
    I keep running, and I feel just fine
    Don't stop when they're reading my rights
    You won't see me when you turn on the lights

    I'm a criminal mind
    I'm stepping over the line
    Watch out!

    Stand back, I'm a criminal mind
    I keep running, and I feel just fine
    Don't stop when they're reading my rights
    You won't see me when you turn on the lights

Lyrics: |-
    You're paranoid from the waist down
    You're paralyzed with the ways you waste your time
    You want to move, but you just mime
    And you get nowhere

    You pack it in for the weekend
    You pick it up and you move in a straight line
    And you say you're just fine
    When there's no one there

    I could fall in love
    Fall in love with a girl like you
    I could change my life
    If you want me to

    I would give it all
    Give it all for a night like that
    If it's what you like
    If you loved me back

    You put it off for a long time
    You put the next episode on your TV
    And you think about leaving
    But you're not so sure

    You hear a sound out the window
    You aren't sure what the band is playing
    Or the words they're saying
    While you lock the door

    I could fall in love
    Fall in love with a girl like you
    I could change my life
    If you want me to

    I would give it all
    Give it all for a night like that
    If it's what you like
    If you loved me back

    If you loved me back, if you loved me back
    What would life be like if you'd just do that?
    Take ahold of what's inside
    Your broken heart

    If you took my hand, if you took my hand
    Would it be so hard to understand
    How the world was before
    It fell apart
    When it all seemed new
    For a girl like you

    I could fall in love
    Fall in love with a girl like you
    I could change my life
    If you want me to

    I would give it all
    Give it all for a night like that
    If it's what you like
    If you loved me back

    I could fall in love
    Fall in love with a girl like you—
    I could fall in love
    Fall in love with a girl like you—
    I could fall in love
    Fall in love with a girl like you

Lyrics: |-
    (Hands up)

    Hands up for the highwayman
    We're headed to the Holy Land
    It's low and loud
    We're going down

    No knock, turn a friend to foe
    There won't be a second show
    You're bleeding out
    You're screaming now

    Take away my body
    Take away my body
    Give me back my fever dreams
    Give me back my everything

    Operator, operator, we've been dying on the dance floor
    We've been dying on the dance floor
    Soon or later, soon or later, you'll be getting what you came for
    You'll be getting what you came for

    Operator, operator, there's a fire in the flashing lights
    For the blood of communion
    Just a taste to remember you by

    (Hands up)

    Hands up for the hit parade
    We're headed to the Golden Gate
    So say goodbye
    We leave tonight

    Hail, hail, to the rock 'n' roll
    This bop ought to break your soul
    Right open wide
    It's such a ride

    Take away my body
    Take away my body
    Give me back my R&B
    Give me back my, give me back my

    Operator, operator, we've been dying on the dance floor
    We've been dying on the dance floor

    Soon or later, soon or laterm you'll be getting what you came for
    You'll be getting what you came for

    Operator, operator, there's an iron in the ebb of time
    It's a kiss out of heaven
    Just a piece to remain when you die

    I'm an agent by trade
    I'm a vandal at heart
    I find the weakest piece
    And pull it all apart

    I've been on every side
    You know they're all the same
    You recognize my face
    But you don't know my name

    Sabotage
    You want to get into the entourage
    You've got to use a little camouflage
    If you want to break into the scene, oh yeah

    Sabotage
    You take a hammer to the fuselage
    You wish them all a little bon voyage
    And you never say a thing, oh yeah

    Sabotage
    And when they're firing off a grand barrage
    You disappear into a thin mirage

    I'm right in front of your eyes
    I'm living under your nose
    But you don't know I'm there
    Until the bomber blows

    I wear a hat and a coat
    I wear a suit and a tie
    I'm looking just like you
    And you pass me right by

    Sabotage
    You want to get into the entourage
    You've got to use a little camouflage

    You think you know it all
    But you don't know yourself
    You've got it all together

    When I think about you
    On the way back home
    Take away my blues
    When I'm all alone
    Flicker of your smile
    In the evening air
    Through the highway miles
    I can feel you there

    When I think about you
    When I think about you
    When I think about you
    When I think about you

    When I think about you
    Wonder where you are
    Look around my room
    Open up my heart
    Let it all come free
    When the night is long
    Take a walk with me
    'Til the world is gone

    Forces acting on a point
    Every pivot of the joint
    Feel the friction when it starts
    The mechanism of the heart

    What you see in all your dreams
    Replicated by machines
    This is what you really are
    The mechanism of the heart

    With the turning of the hands
    See the universe expand
    They're the dancers in the dark
    The mechanism of the heart

    Pull the cables in the ground
    Every wire full of sound
    This is ripping me apart
    The mechanism of heart

    Little pieces, little pieces
    Wind up and we wear them out (Wind up and wear them out)
    Heavy metal, heavy metal
    Heaven knows what you're holding down (What you are holding down)

    Now we're shifting into gear
    As we burn away the years
    You will finish what you start
    The mechanism of the heart (Mechanism of the heart)
    The mechanism of the heart (Mechanism of the heart)
    The mechanism of the heart (Mechanism of the heart)
    The mechanism of the heart (Mechanism of the heart)

    The mechanism of the heart
    The mechanism of the heart

    Little pieces, little pieces
    Wind up and we wear them out (Wind up and wear them out)
    Heavy metal, heavy metal
    Heaven knows what you're holding down (What you are holding down)

    Fully loaded, fully loaded
    Watch out when the spring unwinds (When the spring unwinds)
    Now or never, now or never
    No warning, we're wasting time

    Forces acting on a point

    Feel the friction when it starts
    The mechanism of the heart (Mechanism of the heart)

Lyrics: |-
    I've been pulling favors out of privileged hands
    I've been taking credit where the credit's due
    Stole the name of someone from a foreign land
    You're the only one I've ever told this to

    Gave away the total sum of who I was to now become
    The man who stands before your eyes today
    Living in the limelight of a fancy turned to full-time bluff
    Still waiting for the sting of my disgrace

    I stole my identity from another man who looks like me
    And I don't know what he knows (I don't know what he knows)
    But I know he knows my name (I know he knows my name)
    And I have myself to blame (I have myself to blame)
    Do you think he's in here now? (Do you think he's in here now?)
    Do you see him in the mirror? (Do you see him in the mirror?)
    Do you think he knows I'm here?

    I've been filching francs from banks in Switzerland
    I've been cashing traveller's checks in Cameroon
    Drank at the Mirage and dried up at the Sands
    Never thought of what this might be coming to

    Thought for sure that he was dead and I might take his place instead
    Become the man I always wished to be
    Never knew the men he killed or asked how all the vaults were filled
    But now I fear he's finally come for me

    I stole my identity from another man who looks like me
    And I don't know what he knows (I don't know what he knows)
    But I know he knows my name (I know he knows my name)
    And I have myself to blame (I have myself to blame)
    I can hear him coming now (I hear him coming now)
    I can feel him in the air (I feel him in the air)
    And I know he knows I'm there

    I stole my identity from another man who looks like me
    And I know that I will not go free
    'Cause there's only room for one, you see

    And I don't know what he knows (I don't know what he knows)
    But I know he knows my name (I know he knows my name)
    And I have myself to blame (I have myself to blame)
    I can taste his bullet now (I taste his bullet now)
    I can smell his blood-soaked hands (I smell his blood-soaked hands)
    I could not forget this man (I can't forget this man)

    I am trying to escape (I'm trying to escape)
    But there's nowhere left to run (There's nowhere left to run)
    For I know now what I've done (I know now what I've done)
    I have laid inside his bed (I've laid inside his bed)
    Stood before his vanity (Stood before his vanity)
    And I know that man is me

    Powerline
    I feel the static when your hand's in mine

    Just like a thunderbolt into your spine

    Come get electric with me now
    Oh-oh

    It's the feeling that you give me
    Just like déjà vu
    I'm already so nostalgic
    For this moment with you

    I can feel what you're thinking
    And I know just what you want
    You've got that real live connection
    That can really turn you on

    Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
    Come get electric

    It's a little bit magic
    How we lose control
    With our bodies in motion
    While we share the same soul

    We are human machinery
    And the contacts are live
    So come on and close the circuit
    Use the power that's inside

    Powerline
    I feel the static when your hand's in mine
    One little spark and we'll be intertwined
    Come get electric with me now
    Oh-oh

    Powerline
    Just like a thunderbolt into your spine
    One little shock and it could blow your mind
    Come get electric with me now
    Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
    Come get electric

Lyrics: |-
    There's a moment yet to come
    When we'll learn to live as one
    Every second in the sun
    Will be wonderful

    Spoke the poet and the priest
    "They will rise among the least"
    It was wisdom from the east
    Kept you comfortable

    Now the highs are looking low
    For the people that you know
    Selling tickets to the show
    That never opened up

    For today you're not so sure
    What you're really waiting for
    With your face slammed in the door
    Of Utopia

    There was time enough at last
    You discarded all the past
    We remolded in the cast
    Of our victory

    With the future full of light
    We would rage against the night
    Ever certain of the right
    Side of history

    Now the skies are looking gray
    For the weary castaway
    Feel the waters of the bay
    Crashing over ya

    While you wander like a ghost
    With the ones you missed the most
    When you washed upon the coast
    Of Utopia

    Time wasted
    I've tasted
    One too many tongues in my life

    Ideals
    So real
    One push and we fall on the knife

    Love is not enough for you
    It's a point of view
    It's a program

    Years in the dark are alright
    And you won't catch the sight
    Of your own sham

Lyrics: |-
    I know it's just a game we're playing
    But when you walk away, I wish that you were staying
    It's a crazy thing to do, getting all caught up in you
    When I'm not so sure I still contain the room within my heart
    To put away the pieces when we circle back to start

    It's always easy when we're joking
    Act like we're little kids, but really we are growing
    At the ending of the day, when we're out of things to say
    Would you tell me you were happy just to be here when we part
    And we wouldn't have to wonder when we'd circle back to start

    Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
    We're going around and round
    Round and round

    Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
    We're going around and round
    Round and round

    And when I see you in the evening
    I'll walk beside you because I am also leaving
    There's a pause before we do, like you very nearly knew
    What the looks on both our faces were betraying in the dark
    While the actors take their places and we circle back to start

    Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
    We're going around and round
    Round and round

    Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
    We're going around and round
    Round and round

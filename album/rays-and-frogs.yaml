    In this album, there are 4 songs that are pretty much identical, except for the instruments; that's because all frogs are pretty much the same, save one aspect. Eventually, they 'merge' to become the genesis frog, except it doesn't really merge, just becomes yet another variety.

    Rather than merging everything, I just went to basics with a square wave, 5th saw wave and charang sound; the charang returns, but does a different duty this time.

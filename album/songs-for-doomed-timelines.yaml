Lyrics: |-
    Hello, my candy coated darling, it's your vanilla baby
    I've come to say I love you and I always have
    I find it so amusing, I used to be confused and
    Afraid that you would never love me

    Back but now I see that we were always meant to be
    You and me forever planting lots of family trees
    Counting out our children, half a zillion at least
    We'll name the boys for you and we will name the girls for me

    Haa haa haa
    Haa haa haa

    Hello, the sour peach of my skin, the sweetest poison icing
    So tasty it could rot your teeth and brain
    The chaotic consumption, the diabetic gumption
    To do a thing like make me go insane

    And leave this plane of reality completely
    Float among the clouds of pink and blue cotton candy
    Let's blast into space and race around like aeroplanes
    Spreading multicolored chemtrails, soda pop, and acid rain

    Feels so neat
    Never wanna be myself again
    I just wanna be sweet (sweet)
    Feels so fun
    Never wanna come back down

    Feels so neat
    Never wanna be myself again
    I just wanna be sweet (sweet)
    Feels so fun
    Never wanna come back down
    Come back down

    Haa (haa) haa (haa) haa (haa)
    Haa (haa) haa (haa) haa (haa)
    Haa (haa) haa (haa)

    Goodbye to heartbreak on my birthday, annoying boys who hurt me
    With all the stupid things they do and say
    I can't even remember what I was so upset for
    Spun sugar melts in water anyway

    So no more crying, dry those tears, I'll end your pain
    Soon you'll feel the cherry syrup running through your veins
    Heaven is a grinning face with not a trace of shame
    Take a taste of every flavour, favor anything but plain

    Feels so neat
    Never wanna be myself again
    I just wanna be sweet (sweet)
    Feels so fun
    Never wanna come back down
    Feels so neat
    Never wanna be myself again
    I just wanna be sweet (sweet)
    Feels so fun
    Never wanna come back down

    Haa (haa) haa (haa) haa (haa)
    Haa (haa) haa (haa) haa (haa)
    Haa (haa) haa (haa) haa (haa)
    Haa (haa) haa (haa) haa (haa)
    Haa (haa) haa (haa) haa (haa)
    Haa (haa) haa (haa) haa (haa)
    Haa (haa) haa (haa) haa (haa)

    Homestuck Filk, for the Rose/Kanaya pairing.
Lyrics: |-
    You've got a new dress, you're a quick change actress
    Your lipstick slides out of its sheath
    You're my neon-veined day-glow dame, how do you speak
    With your tongue pressed so tight to your teeth?

    You've got a lot of dead friends on this rock where we're floating
    There's darkness ahead, but I think it's worth noting
    We're candles, we're matches, we're lights on a wire
    So come with me, please be my Sylph set on fire

    In all honesty, I expected to be
    Exceptionally unimpressed
    I do not trust kindness, in kindnesses lies are hid
    And oft topped with makeup, and winningly dressed

    But you've got a mind, and if you don't mind me saying
    It resides in a beauty not slightly betraying
    Your luminesce, I confess, I guess you're no liar
    So come with me, please be my Sylph set on fire

Lyrics: |-
    I’m gonna have a nightmare tonight
    I’m gonna be my nightmare tonight

    You’re pretty picky, you’re a clique of one
    I’m right though, surely I’m not the only gun you’ve got loaded?
    How do you keep from gloating?
    You’re pretty tricky, did you pick that shade
    Just to distract from the flash of the shining blade you’ve got hidden?
    Deep wounds overwritten

    I had so many new friends to see
    So many possibilities
    Now I couldn’t possibly feel worse
    I had so many fires left to nurse

    In my nightmare tonight I’ll see giant leviathans
    Breaking the water in half with their shining skin
    riding them laughing you’ll be in my nightmare tonight

    In my nightmare tonight I’ll see beasts all stampeding
    Your signia burned onto haunches still healing
    And leading the pack on their backs in my nightmare tonight
    You’ll be in my nightmare tonight, tonight…

    You’re pretty ugly when you get down to it,
    Combined, I’ve half a mind to just say screw it and break completely,
    Or surrender so sweetly
    I thought I’d have a chance to be my own,
    Free from the tyranny of your tarnished throne.
    Now I see that kingdom belongs to me, oh no…
    I had so many irons in the fire
    So many brands and swords
    To their backsides I had even more
    So many plans on what they’re for

    In my nightmare tonight, there’s volcanoes erupting
    A red hot web veining the land, it’s disgusting
    Cracked mountains of madness, your hand in my nightmare tonight

    In my nightmare tonight I’ll see me all consumed,
    And attempting to sing disharmonious tunes with you.
    Asynchronicity, I am in misery. I am in misery!
    What has been done to me?
    In my nightmare tonight (X4)

    In my nightmare tonight I’ll see giant leviathans
    Breaking the water in half with their shining skin
    Riding them laughing you’ll be in my nightmare tonight
    You’ll be in my nightmare tonight

    <i>PhemieC:</i> ([SoundCloud commentary](https://soundcloud.com/hamsters/our-aftermath))
    Simple, sleepy Davesprite filk. Just to get the idea out of my head...
Lyrics: |-
    You were called like a curtain, split like a second, broken like a sword stuck in a rock
    Forged for a hero, birthed forth for a heart much purer than his/mine/ours
    It's uncertain when the tables turned, but when all of your brothers have given their lives
    For the strife you earned, you will get burned and it won't get better when put on ice

    And I wasn't going anywhere fast, and my sister said she'd seen the end of my path
    The direction that I fly, straight through the eye of our aftermath

    And you have to ignore it, don't think about before, you've got enough fight inside to fill five world wars
    It's just a game, just another cause, you're a switch and I'm a cog And the last thing we need is another broken clock
    So forget about your ghost limbs and all those things that scared you most as a child of twelve
    You see I'm thirteen now, and if I die for the thousandth time, I'm unafraid, for I outnumber hell

    And I wasn't going anywhere good, so I straightened my glasses and I did what I could
    What I had to but damn it's hard not to look back at the time

    But I wasn't going anywhere fast, so I said goodbye to walking my own path
    The direction that I fly, straight through the eye of our aftermath

    What makes us who we are, is it our bones?
    Wrapped in all our scars, they're ours alone
    They outweigh tails and talons, feathers, foam
    Unless they're not, unless they don't

    You were called like a curtain, split like a second, broken like a sword stuck in a rock

    Some experimental, relaxing filk about the Post-Scratch Alpha Kids. :)
Lyrics: |-
    I am an island, no man is an island but me
    I reach out my leaves, and skillfully touch them to sea
    I ship out a boat made of hope on the waves and watch as it slips below
    I am an island, a island that nobody knows
    (...I am an island, I am an island, I am an island)

    I am an island, no man is an island but I'm not a man
    (I am an island, I am an island, I am an island, I am an island)
    I was raised by an ocean of creatures and brands
    (I am an island, I am an island, I am an island, I am an island)
    I give what I can of, the fruits and flowers that bloom on my skin
    (I am an island, I am an island, I am an island, I am an island)
    But when loneliness knocks, she lets herself in
    (I am an island, I am an island, I am an island)

    Islands don't sink, the water just rises around us
    Just think, someone out there is watching the stars
    But they're not the same as ours, some say they're already dead
    And the light's only on in your head

    I am an island, no man is an island but me
    (I am an island, I am an island, I am an island, I am an island)
    I warm all my sands by the pyre of my family tree
    (I am an island, I am an island, I am an island, I am an island)
    I took to the tundra, I climb every mountain and fight every monster I can
    (I am an island, I am an island, I am an island, I am an island, I am an island)
    To run from that long burning fire, my friend
    (I am an island, I am an island, I am an island, I am an island)

    I am an island, no man is an island but I'm not a man
    (I am an island, I am an island, I am an island, I am an island, I am an island)
    And messages in bottles feel like battering rams
    (I am an island, I am an island, I am an island, I am an island)
    In my head I'm a beacon (In my head I'm a beacon), a pinprick of potential birthed out of nothing but blue
    (I am an island, I am an island, I am an island, I am an island, I am an island)
    And the light that I signal, it's shining for you
    (I am an island, I am an island, oh, oh, oh)

    Islands of love, we just want somebody to touch us
    Just 'cause we are distant doesn't mean we are lost
    We are where we are, and whenever a visitor docks
    And is stranded, it means we are not

    You and I have something in common, I will try to share my island (You and I are islands)
    You and I are sinking in tandem, miles apart in every direction (You and I are islands)
    You and I are treading this current, both of us are doomed for certain (You and I are islands)
    You and I are our own now, maybe we'll wash up on solid ground (You and I are islands)
    You and I are islands
    You and I are islands
    You and I are islands
    You and I are islands

    Islands of fate, lately I feel the tides shifting
    They're bringing us closer together to stay
    The waters are rippling, a new world is taking it's shape
    And tonight, our Pangaea awaits

Lyrics: |-
    I said a word
    But, it got caught in my throat, and it burned
    Slipped off my tongue and I choked,
    You were concerned for a second
    Then cries echoed into the night
    Lesson learned

    Because you heard a word
    That I said, and this word how it rang
    In your head, it was loud and glorious, yes
    And from where you lay on my chest, well
    You heard it best

    But you held me closely while I screamed
    And I watched the thinnest trails of green
    Run down your neck, and drip from your chin
    Thin trails of green, thin lines, on gray skin

    Thin lines on gray skin
    Thin lines on gray skin
    Where the world ends, that’s were we begin
    My thin line, my thin line

    I said a word
    Was it a blessing or curse?
    Nobody knows the whole story,
    Nobody hears me but you
    And you would have heard more if you could have, I’m sure
    Because you heard my word,
    You still do with your hands, eyes and rest of you too
    Little stray on my lap, zealot, hellcat
    Can’t forgive what I did to my dream-maker,
    Has thou forsaken her?

    And if you knew what I knew, would you object?
    Are we madmen or soothsayers? Truthfully, sweet heretic?
    I bit off the bit that silenced the world for you, sewed up my sin
    With thin threads of black
    Thin lines on gray skin

    Thin lines on gray skin
    Thin lines on gray skin
    Where the world ends, that’s where our work begins
    My thin line, my thin line

Commentary: |-
    <i>PhemieC:</i> ([SoundCloud commentary](https://soundcloud.com/hamsters/nobodies))
    A simple fansong for the pairing Rufioh/Koruss for Homestuck. I can't help it, I'm a serial overthinker.
Lyrics: |-
    Do you remember being nobodies
    Discovering nothing was not that bad
    When shared as a pair, both lost and long suffering
    Hiding in a frightening land

    And do you remember feeling that anger
    Yet so much love and "for what?" you wondered
    And now there's no wondering, the wrong nervous muttering
    No magic left at all

    But I remember leaning against a backwards bent wing
    And awaking to feel that your touch didn't sting
    When everything was wrong, I made so many mistakes
    And you helped me make them, but with presence and patience

    All those wrong, awful, wild, amazingly childish decisions

    I take a breath, and I know I've got to
    Turn the final page
    But is our story really done yet?
    I guess I'm still afraid

    But do you remember, just being honest
    Little bright moments of peace in the trees
    Now it takes so much work to be with you
    I'd say that I miss you, but for that you'd have to leave

    But I remember once forever seemed too short a time
    Though not long enough for me to make up my mind
    I would've thought eternity would eventually make me wise
    Enough to choose a side, not just linger undecided
    Why do I feel changed when we both have stayed the same
    It feels like something's different, some ache too big to name
    When everything is endless and you're nineteen yet again
    And you're never flawed enough but you keep on pretending

    Wanting that desperate, "forget me not/do you love me yet?" ending

    But there's no ending. There's nobody. Just two nobodies

    Some short Rose filk for a friend. :)
Lyrics: |-
    What a vision of darkness, creeps in with desperate sharpness, lecherous grafting of knowledge to my young mortal subconscious
    Words writ by breath of the ancients, wiser than even the pagans, or the wizened old men with wands and white beards that once were ensconced in my pages

    Obfuscated by doom, and laden with arduous tasks are the pathways laid out for the lot of us
    Mages and witches and princes and maids, pages with inches of space for mistakes

    I am the beast, I am the light, I am the blighted being cursed with sight
    I am the god who created a world, I am leviathan, the girl

    I can do it on my own, but you're a hero after all, and we may think our sacrifice is just but pride comes right before the fall
    The cascade of rain on my needles, a hand grasping tight to the bottle, of a woman with untapped potential, the ennui of too late and too little

    Our failures have made, a bridge for success, if our game is half played, then who's played the rest of it?
    Heroes we were in a universe doomed, soldiers in battles best left un-exhumed

    I am the beast, I am the light, I am the blighted being cursed with sight
    I am the god who created a world, I am leviathan, the girl. And-

    I can do it on my own
    We can do it on our own
    Aut viam inveniam aut faciam
    Aut viam inveniam aut faciam

    I am Leviathan, the girl...

    A KarGamRezi fansong on charango.

Lyrics: |-
    There’s a boy here lying quiet in my shadow like a prayer
    He drips from every angle into colours that I wear
    He wanders like a saint on predatory pilgrimage
    With a grimace and a limp he puts his wrist against my cartilage

    And I could separate these bones, I could pack them into prose
    Or I could hold a cancer in my soul until it overflows
    But there is only boy and breath
    Gentle handprints on my chest
    Mouthing little darling, deepest, loveliest of sacrilege

    This boy of filth, he’s born of Gods
    He clutches at my flaws, he drags me from my holocaust
    He takes my limbs, he wraps them around him
    He takes my shake and takes my sick and feeds me bread and then

    These violent wall eyed dreams that mite their way into my fear of me and mine
    These wines and sugars in my blood, they mutter “Take your claws and climb
    The inch of every pale moon love, you once swore you’d pay nevermind”
    When I am on the side of you, I’d say my gods were always lying
    Lying

    There’s a girl pacing around me, proselytizing parasite
    Her sick, acidic logic ridicules the ancient rite
    And when her teeth break up on me like tiny cliffs of chalk
    I crash into her canyon, lick the injuries she likes to mock

    And I could cut her down to size, it’s half as hard as compromise
    Or I could watch a blind sleepwalker creep all sweet and none-the-wise
    But there is only girl and grin, curling up under my skin
    Picture you and I forgetting why we let the other in

    This judge of what, she’s born of mud
    She answers to no blood, she will not let me chew the cud
    She spits and swells, she wears her wretched well
    She holds my soul with taxes, tolls, and takes it straight to hell

    These violent wall eyed dreams that mite their way into my fear of me and mine
    These wines and sugars in my blood, they mutter “Take your claws and climb
    The inch of every rotten hate, I once swore I’d pay nevermind!”
    When I am on the side of you, you’d say your law was always lying
    Your law, it must be lying
    My Gods, they must be lying
    Lying

    A Beta Kids Christmas song, each stanza is a different kid. Happy Holidays folks!
Lyrics: |-
    You call me down for Christmas cake
    Although that's not a thing, I sigh
    But I take a plate, I take a bite
    And the look that you give me is heavy with pride

    You bring me sticks that you find in the wild
    And I count every one and then hang them
    Over the fire with patterns of wire and bow
    Then we roll on the carpet and howl in the snow

    There is a place that I'm home
    In condos, apartments, in suburbs and islands
    There is a face that I know
    And wherever it is I find that my Christmas isn't cold

    You wake me up by dumping presents
    On my bed and forcing my head
    Into a hat that's red and white
    Then it's up to the roof for a snowball fight

    You get the brandy and offer me some
    Although we both know I'm too young
    And when I refuse you're amused then pass out
    So I turn on the reruns and watch them with you on the couch

    There is a place that I'm home
    In condos, apartments, in suburbs and islands
    There is a face that I know
    And wherever it is I find that my Christmas isn't cold
    That my Christmas isn't cold

    It's the end of the day and it's way too late
    But I log in just to say "Hi!"
    What's up? What did you get? What was your Christmas like?

    There is a place that I'm home
    In condos, apartments, in suburbs and islands
    There is a face that I know
    And wherever it is I find that my Christmas isn't cold
    My Christmas isn't cold
    My Christmas isn't cold
    My Christmas isn't cold
    My Christmas isn't cold
    My Christmas isn't cold
    My Christmas isn't cold
    Ho, ho, ho...home

Lyrics: |-
    I'll leave you my bottles, babe
    I'll wrap them in wool and
    Lay them down in your crib
    I'll miss what might have been

    I'll leave you my swords and shades
    I'll put all my good into one place
    And irony's aftertaste
    Will rock to you sleep, my babe

    When you watch what we made for you
    When you see what we gave for you
    When you read between the lines, you'll find
    We waited our lives for you

    But in seconds my time will end
    I count every breath my friend
    And when space invades again
    We'll light the way, my baby

    So when thе light catches blade
    When thе time comes, do not be afraid
    Follow the path we've made
    Follow the path we've made

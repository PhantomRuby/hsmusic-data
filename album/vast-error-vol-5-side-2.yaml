    Too little. Too late.

    this track - sorry, this fucking SUITE - is really something else. for a while, i didn't know if i was gonna get it done in time for Vol. 5, but boy am i glad i did. what started out as a crazy idea for a four-part orchestral suite covering the lore of Prospit and Derse turned into... well, just that, but actually real! it's a little personal confidence boost that i can actually get these ridiculously ambitious projects done sometimes.

    Motions:<br>
    0:00 I. Gray Area<br>
    1:00 II. Derse<br>
    3:35 III. Prospit<br>
    7:30 IV. The Battlefield

Lyrics: |-
    A book to be read
    Story that's spun
    Each thread entangled together make one
    A play with no acts
    A film on a reel
    That catches alight when forced through the wheel

    I'm your ghost writer
    Every stare
    Looks right through
    Call me ghost writer
    Let me say
    My words too
    I'm your ghost writer
    Play my tape
    If you would
    Call me ghost writer
    Lost to time
    Gone for good

    How long has it been
    The wices and the days
    Does each look remind you of his gaze
    I've faces to choose
    But each is the same
    When I am the mirror of your pain
    Each glance that I take
    Is stolen with fear
    One look and I might just disappear

    Call me ghost writer
    Call me ghost writer
    Call me ghost writer
    Call me ghost writer

    I'm your ghost writer
    Every stare
    Looks right through
    Call me ghost writer
    Let me say
    My words too
    I'm your ghost writer
    Play my tape
    If you would
    Call me ghost writer
    Lost to time
    Gone for good

    <i>Rainy:</i> ([YouTube description](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLjswX3Z_P4), excerpt)

    So, since before I joined the VEMT, I wanted to remix [[Chamber Cultist]] from Vast Error Vol.4. That song is one of personal favorite VE songs and I thought it would be fun to remix it. When I did eventually join the team, I figured it was my time to do so. As for the song itself, I wanted to play around with the main Chamber Cultist motif in a 12/8-time signature. In additional I wanted to see how I could twist the motif while still keeping it identifiable. It’s probably the craziest song I did out of the 3 for vol.5 in terms of rhythm and it’s a favorite for that reason. “Fun” fact: the name “Ritual Summoning” comes from a type of special summoning where you have to sacrifice monsters to the grave to summon a powerful “Ritual Monster.” Not sure why but I feel that it’s perfect considering who this song is about ;)

Lyrics: |-
    I have you on repeat
    Grasping for tender moments I hold on to like delicate keepsakes
    They are so few and far between
    And I'm grateful for the memorability of each moment
    Moments wrapped in romance that end with bitter sunrises and goodbyes
    Moments so fragile and rare that I wonder if they would have the same taste if not such a delicacy
    But I'd still devour you.

Lyrics: |-
    When the chill of earth black-breasted is uplifted at the
    glance
    Of the red sun million-crested, and the forest blossoms
    dance
    With the light that stirs and lustres of the dawn, and with
    the bloom
    Of the wind’s cheek as it clusters from the hidden valley’s
    gloom
    Then I walk in woodland spaces, musing on the solemn
    ways
    Of the immemorial places shut behind the starry rays
    Of the East and all its splendor, of the West and all its peace
    And the stubborn lights grow tender, and the hard sounds
    hush and cease
    In the wheel of heaven revolving, mysteries of death and
    birth
    In the womb of time dissolving, shape anew a heaven and
    earth
    Ever changing, ever growing, ever dwindling, ever dear,
    ever worth the passion glowing to distill a doubtful tear
    These are with me, these are of me, these approve me,
    these obey
    Choose me, move me, fear me, love me, master of the
    night and day
    These are real, these illusion
    I am of them, false or frail
    True or lasting, all is fusion in the spirit’s shadow-veil, 'til the knowledge
    lotus flowering hides the world beneath its stem
    Neither I, nor nor God life-showering, find a counterpart in
    them
    As a spirit in a vision shows a countenance in fear
    Laughs the looker to derision, only comes to disappear
    Gods and mortals, mind and matter, in the glowing bud
    dissever
    Vein from vein they rend and shatter, and are nothingness
    forever
    In the blessed, the enlightened, perfect eyes these visions
    pass
    Pass and cease, poor shadows frightened, leave no stain upon the glass
    One last stroke, O heart-free master, one last certain
    calm of will
    And the maker of disaster shall be stricken and grow
    still
    Burn thou to the core of matter, to the spirit’s utmost
    flame
    Consciousness and sense to shatter, ruin sight and form
    and name
    Shatter, lake-reflected spectre; lake, rise up in mist to
    sun
    Sun, dissolve in showers of nectar, and the Master’s
    work is done
    Nectar perfume gently stealing, masterful and sweet and
    strong
    Cleanse the world with light of healing in the ancient
    house of wrong
    Free a million mortals on the wheel of being
    tossed
    Open wide the mystic portals, and be altogether lost

    LEAVE
    JUST LEAVE
    JUST LEAVE
    JUST LEAVE
    JUST LEAVE
    JUST LEAVE
    JUST LEAVE
    JUST LEAVE
    JUST LEAVE

Lyrics: |-
    Stretching out like an endless road
    A future path that's still unknown
    Each twist and turn, I wanna take
    The biggest leap, I gotta make

    I wanna live for today
    See the suns rise again and again
    I wanna love this day
    How many ways can I stretch out each moment
    So end never comes
    Never stays
    Living out each day
    We stay together

    I wanna live for today
    I love living this way
    I wanna love today

    (It finally dawned on me
    What the messages said
    That I was just
    A waste of space)

    I wanna live for today
    See the suns rise again and again
    I wanna love this day
    How many ways can I stretch out each moment
    So end never comes
    Never stays
    Living out each day
    We stay together

    I wanna live for today

    Is there anything more to to Jack Noir?

    i am so fucking proud of this song. up there with [[Kingdom Come]] as one of the coolest, most ambitious things i've ever done musically. the VEMT has pretty strict rules on referencing HS motifs, but neither me nor [[artist:austinado|austin]] could resist that fucking [[Cascade (Beta)|Cascade]] reference, and so he gave me the go-ahead to use it here.

Lyrics: |-
    I was there
    When the clouds parted
    Do you remember the day we met?
    I walked the ocean

    I remember the night you told me
    Never to get too close
    Because your cold heart would leave me burnt
    Believe me

    I think back to who i was
    I don't recognize those days
    I'm still thinking about you
    How I missed you so much

    Do you remember last year? Last year?
    The way we used to touch?
    Are you still thinking about me?
    Do you miss me so much?

    Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

    I promise that no matter we've gone, no matter,
    I'll leave my heart, in the palm of your hand
    I promise that no matter how tragic, I'll wait,
    do it again, it's crazy but...

    I promise that no matter we've gone, no matter,
    I'll leave my heart, in the palm of your hand
    I promise that no matter how tragic, I'll wait,
    do it again, it's crazy but...

    I promise that no matter we've gone, no matter,
    I'll leave my heart, in the palm of your hand
    I promise that no matter how tragic, I'll wait,
    do it again, it's crazy but...

    I promise that no matter we've gone, no matter,

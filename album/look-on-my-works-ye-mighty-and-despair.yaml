    <i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i>
    Hello, aliens from the future. This is an album of music written and produced by me, Michael Guy Bowman. People recognized me as a hero and a king in my lifetime. By now, civilization has certainly perished. If there are any surviving humans, they're probably mutated beyond recognition and a real bummer to hang with. If nothing else remains, gaze upon this artifact for a little taste of what life was like in another time when things were actually pretty cool.

Lyrics: |-
    Why does this feeling always come to me
    Like there's some place that I'm supposed to be
    Oh hold me closer, I don't want to go
    Look in my eyes and you will know I know

    This is as good as it gets
    Oh don't you know this is as good as it gets
    I feel like I'm the greatest man in the world
    You are my favorite girl
    This is as good as it gets

    This is as good as it gets
    Oh don't you know this is as good as it gets
    Nobody else in all the whole human race
    Could know the look on your face
    This is as good as it gets

    Why does it hit me when I least suspect?
    My mouth is running but the mood's direct
    Oh let me linger, I'm a lonely soul
    Just take my hand and I will take control

    Good as it gets
    Oh don't you know this is as good as it gets
    I feel like I'm the greatest man in the world
    You are my favorite girl
    This is as good as it gets

    This is as good as it gets
    Oh don't you know this is as good as it gets
    Nobody else in all the whole human race
    Could know the look on your face
    This is as good as it gets

    Good as it gets
    Oh don't you know this is as good as it gets
    I feel like I'm the greatest man in the world
    You are my favorite girl
    This is as good as it gets

    This is as good as it gets
    Oh don't you know this is as good as it gets
    Nobody else in all the whole human race
    Could know the look on your face
    This is as good as it gets

    Just when I think I should be cooling my jets
    This is as good as it gets
    This is as good as it gets
    Whoa-oa-oa
    My head is racing 'cause it's not over yet
    This is as good as it gets
    This is as good as it gets gets gets
    You bat your amber eyes
    And now I know why
    This is as good as it good as it good as it gets

    Why do we leave each other in the night
    We walk away just when the mood is right
    Oh wait for me, you know I need you now
    Show me your heart and I will show you how

Lyrics: |-
    Someday when you leave your mother's
    Would you come and stay with me?
    There's no action in the suburbs
    I know who you want to be

    We want to be like like like angels
    We want to be like like like angels
    We want to be like like like angels
    With our feet way up in the clouds

    We want to be like like like angels
    We want to be like like like angels
    We want to be like like like angels
    And we won't even touch the ground

    I've been waiting in the city
    For a friend to show around
    I know where the sights are pretty
    Come with me and paint the town

    We want to be like like like angels
    We want to be like like like angels
    We want to be like like like angels
    With our feet way up in the clouds

    We want to be like like like angels
    We want to be like like like angels
    We want to be like like like angels
    And we won't even touch the ground

    Do you feel the rush of feathers
    When we're going out together
    We're the ones who walk beside you
    We're the angels here to guide you
    If you wanna join us say so
    Pretty soon you'll have your halo
    Singing in the choir at Heaven's gate

    All the rooms are full of strangers
    All you want is everything
    You'll go through so many changes
    Someday soon you'll spread your wings

    We want to be like like like angels
    We want to be like like like angels
    We want to be like like like angels
    With our feet way up in the clouds

    We want to be like like like angels
    We want to be like like like angels
    We want to be like like like angels
    And we won't even touch the ground

Lyrics: |-
    I'm waking up wired
    Shake with desire
    Ready to roll, whoa-oh

    I'm hitting the highway
    Doing it my way
    Taking control, whoa-oh

    I'm full of myself
    Couldn't be helped
    I fit the mold, whoa-oh

    I know what I feel
    I am a real
    Sight to behold

    Cuz I'm never gonna run
    Never gonna hide
    I'm telling everyone
    Take a step aside
    I've waited long enough
    Paid a lot of dues
    I'm never giving up
    Never gonna lose

    Never gonna lose, never gonna lose
    Never gonna lose, never gonna lose
    Never gonna lose, never gonna lose
    I don't know why or how
    I'm just unstoppable now

    I'm gone from the starter
    I'm racing harder
    I'm gonna win, whoa-oh

    I'm lapping the legends
    Stealing attention
    Raking it in, whoa-oh

    I'm chasing the dream
    Making it seem
    Easy to do, whoa-oh

    I'm knocking on wood
    Feels so good
    I'm breaking through

    And I'm never gonna stop
    Never gonna stall
    Never see me drop
    Never see me fall
    I'm never gonna make
    Another lame excuse
    I'm never gonna break
    Never gonna lose

    Never gonna lose, never gonna lose
    Never gonna lose, never gonna lose
    Never gonna lose, never gonna lose
    I don't know why or how
    I'm just unstoppable now

    Relight the fire of a faded era
    You're gonna watch me beat the odds
    I won't be shaped by the things that scare us
    I'm gonna rise like a brand new god

    I'm gonna walk across the water
    Shout out my name from the mountaintops
    I'm gonna dance with the devil's daughter
    I'll show the world that I can't be stopped

    I wanna break down every border
    Shake off the shackles of my cage
    I'm gonna change the Earthly order
    Shine in the light of a golden age

    I'll show the world just what I'm made of
    Make them a deal they can't refuse
    I'll go beyond the ones who gave up
    I know I'm never gonna lose

    Never gonna lose, never gonna lose
    Never gonna lose, never gonna lose
    Never gonna lose, never gonna lose
    I don't know why or how
    I'm just unstoppable now

Lyrics: |-
    I used to think we were close, I used to think we were tight
    Just when I needed you most, you made me feel alright
    You told me I was the best, you told me I made you laugh
    And now I've got to confess, you've got me torn up in half
    Cause when I gave you a shot, you told me you'd rather not

    I don't know what I did wrong, I thought we had something good
    We both were getting along, maybe I misunderstood
    Maybe you're just being sweet, maybe you do this a lot
    Talk up the people you meet, give them the best that you got
    Just like it's nothing at all, still I'm the one that you call

    Why do you play with my heart? You know I'm falling apart
    One minute I'm all you want, the next you're already gone
    Why do you play with my soul? You know I'm losing control
    If you would just stay with me, I'd give you all that you need

    You've had me going for months, you've had me all in my head
    Asking what I should have done, if it was something I said
    Was I too eager to love? Should I have just took it slow?
    If I was patient enough, would our relationship grow?
    Would I still stand half a chance, or do you have other plans?

    I ought to just take a "no" and look for somebody new
    I've got a lifetime to go, I shouldn't cry over you
    But now it's so hard to tell if my connections are real
    Have I been foolin' myself, I haven't known how to feel
    Since I thought you were the one, oh baby what have you done?

    Why do you play with my heart? You know I'm falling apart
    One minute I'm all you want, the next you're already gone
    Why do you play with my soul? You know I'm losing control
    If you would just stay with me, I'd give you all that you need

    I thought the signals were right, now I don't know what they mean
    I'm always stuck at the light, can't tell the red from the green
    Have you been changing your mind? Has it been up in the air?
    Or am I simply too blind to see you don't even care?
    I know I'm not being fair, you didn't mean to do wrong
    I should get out of your hair, I should be moving along
    We ought to just let it be, so why are you calling me?

    Why do you play with my heart? You know I'm falling apart
    One minute I'm all you want, the next you're already gone
    Why do you play with my soul? You know I'm losing control
    If you would just stay with me, I'd give you all that you need
    Why do you play with my heart? You know I'm falling apart
    One minute I'm all you want, the next you're already gone
    Why do you play with my soul? You know I'm losing control
    If you would just stay with me, I'd give you all that you need

Lyrics: |-
    My baby my
    Where are you tonight
    Don't you know I need your love
    I been down pretty bad
    And what a week I had
    And the whole year has been rough
    But if you could be here
    It would all disappear
    So won't you please come around
    Because I feel so down

    And I'm calling your name
    'Cause the days are all the same
    And the nights do me no good
    And the people that I know
    Got me feeling pretty low
    And I'm so misunderstood
    But with you here tonight
    It would feel alright
    So won't you bring me your love
    'Cause I can't get enough

    No I can't I can't I can't I can't
    No I can't get enough of you
    I can't I can't I can't I can't
    No I can't get enough of you
    Of the kiss on your lips
    Of the shake in your hips
    Of your sweet sweet love
    No I can't get enough

    Hey baby hey
    Are you on the way
    'Cause I don't know what to do
    My mind is a mess
    And my life is too I guess
    And I've never been so blue
    But it all goes away
    When you come here to stay
    And my head's so clear
    Every time that you're here

    And my heart's goin' fast
    'Cause you're coming home at last
    To the one who wants you most
    And with you as my guest
    You'll be bringing out the best
    In me your cordial host
    So won't you come here now
    'Cause I don't know how
    To go on without your love
    'Cause I can't get enough

    No I can't I can't I can't I can't
    No I can't get enough of you
    I can't I can't I can't I can't
    No i can't get enough of you
    Of the kiss on your lips
    Of the shake in your hips
    Of your sweet sweet love
    No I can't get enough
    No I can't get enough

    No I can't I can't I can't I can't
    No I can't get enough of you
    I can't I can't I can't I can't
    No I can't get enough of you
    Of the kiss on your lips
    Of the shake in your hips

Lyrics: |-
    I broke the golden rule again
    I lost a lover and a friend
    Just when I thought I'd got to know you
    But when I see it in rewind
    And think of all we left behind
    There was no other way to show you

    'Cause I am no believer
    And you don't need me either
    And this is such a breather
    Finally being real

    'Cause it feels like
    No one ever gets the things they want
    No one ever wants the things they have
    So why do we keep faking it so bad?

    And when I think of what went wrong
    You know I'm glad that you are gone
    I got so tired of being patient
    I opened up my beating heart
    And nearly tore myself apart
    To fit in all your expectations

    But I am done pretending
    I'm not your happy ending
    I can't go on defending
    All the time you steal

    'Cause it feels like
    No one ever gets the things they want
    No one ever wants the things they have
    So why do we keep faking it so bad?

    'Cause it feels like
    No one ever gets the things they want
    No one ever wants the things they have
    My heart you just keep breaking it
    Shouldn't be as bad as you're making it
    So why do we keep faking it so bad?

Lyrics: |-
    Have you noticed lately that you and I can do no wrong?
    That every hurdle in the road that ever slowed you down is gone?
    Put the past behind you, put the pieces into place
    Wipe the precious little pouting off the picture of your face

    Don't you feel lucky when you look in the mirror
    And you see me by your side?
    Don't you feel lucky when the moment is right? Oh yeah.
    Don't you feel lucky with your head on my shoulder
    When you're here between my arms?
    You should feel lucky, 'cause I'm your lucky charm.

    I'm your four-leaf clover, I'm the wind across the dice
    I'm the candles on the cake and you can cut yourself a slice
    Make your wish unto me, for now it can be told
    You won the lottery of livin' and I'm givin' you the gold

    Don't you feel lucky when I'm pulling you closer
    In the middle of the night?
    Don't you feel lucky when I'm holding you tight? Oh yeah.
    Don't you feel lucky when you look in my eyes
    And know I'll never do you harm?
    You should feel lucky, 'cause I'm your lucky charm.

    Don't you feel like you've turned around?
    Lookin' up instead of falling down
    I believe in you, and I've been leaving you feeling high, high
    You can let the rabbit have its leg
    Leave the horseshoe hangin' round the peg
    I'm a charmer for your karma and your lovin' is why, why

    Put me in your pocket, and you'll never be the same
    'Cuz every odd and every even's lining up to spell your name
    Lay the cards before you, watch the wheel of fortune turn
    And you can bet I'll get you back just like a jackpot-sized return

    Don't you feel lucky when you wake in the morning
    With the one you're dreaming of?
    Don't you feel lucky falling in love? Oh yeah.
    Don't you feel lucky when there's no one but us
    To hear the six o'clock alarm?
    You should feel lucky, 'cuz I'm your lucky charm.

Lyrics: |-
    I was born in the woods
    I was raised pretty good
    By a pack of hyenas
    I was free in the soul
    I was more animal than man

    I was good on my own
    I was almost fully grown
    When the zookeepers seen us
    Now i know you never knew
    So i gotta tell you who i am

    Way back, i was hunting with my teeth
    Way back, with the jungle floor beneath
    Way back, i was crawlin' on my paws
    Way back, must've broke a lot of laws

    I was trapped in a bag
    I was sent to a lab
    In the back of a college
    I was shaved of my hair
    Given clothes i could wear for free

    I was told how to talk
    How to stand when i walk
    Make displays of my knowledge
    But the fun's worn away
    'Cuz they don't like to play like me

    Take me back, to the sweat and the sun
    Take me back, to the dirt and the dung
    Take me back, to the tongues and the tails
    Take me back, to the slime and the scales

    I'm going back to my roots
    Gonna chew on the fruits
    I'm moving back to the jungle
    I'm gonna grow out my hair
    Learn to growl like a bear
    I'm moving back to the jungle
    I'm gonna roll in the dirt
    Dig a hole 'til it hurts
    I'm moving back to the jungle
    I'm gonna swing from the vines
    Show the world that it's mine
    I'm moving back to the jungle
    Where i'm gonna eat bugs

    When you see me again
    I'll be down in the den
    With the tigers and lions
    I will show you around
    We will go up and down the trees

    Oh the jungle and i
    Will explain you the cycle
    Of livin' and dyin'
    Leave your house, take a right
    'Cuz it's such a crazy sight to see

    I'm going back, gonna crawl down the street
    I'm going back, on my hands and my feet
    I'm going back, i can't pretend anymore
    I'm going back, i'll leave my clothes on the floor

    There is so much to do
    In the woods, you will use
    All five of your senses
    You will taste through your toes
    See the world through your nose in 3d

    There's a part of your brain
    That just can't contain
    'Cuz there's cracks in the fences
    Won't you start looking through
    See the animal you can be

    Come back, to your mother the earth
    Come back, to the instinct of birth
    Come back, leave your worries behind
    Come back, to your reptile mind
    Come back, to the call of the wild
    Come back, like a prodigal child
    Come back, 'cause it's not very far
    Come back, to the creature you are

    I am done with the rules
    Wanna run with the wolves
    I'm moving back to the jungle
    I'm gonna howl at the moon
    Use a stick for a spoon
    I'm moving back to the jungle
    I wanna bathe in the mud
    Make a monkey be my bud
    I'm moving back to the jungle
    I'm gonna love, gonna fight
    Stay up every single night
    I'm moving back to the jungle
    Where i'm gonna eat wood

    I am leaving tonight
    Wanna hunt, wanna bite
    I'm moving back to the jungle
    I wanna bark like a dog
    Gonna sleep in a log
    I'm moving back to the jungle
    I'm gonna swim in the lake
    Slither round with the snakes
    I'm moving back to the jungle
    I was born to be free
    So you know where i will be
    I'm moving back to the jungle
    Where i'm gonna eat dirt

Lyrics: |-
    Existential dread
    Gets into your head
    Gets into your bed with you

    Awful little thoughts
    Tie you up in knots
    Everybody's got a few

    Endless are the nights
    Filling you with frights
    'Til you turn the lights back on

    Reoccurring pains
    Driving you insane
    You're here but yet your brain is gone

    When you turn around
    There's nothing to be found
    There's nothing pulling down on you

    Nothing like a ghost
    The horror show you host
    That leaves your mind the most to do

    If I shook you now
    Would it get you out
    Or would you only shout at me?

    Are you in a dream
    Or somewhere in between?
    It's never what it seems to be

    And you know that there's no one there
    But you still get scared sometimes
    And you know that it's in your mind
    Push it right back through the blinds

    Cotton are the sheets
    Tugging at your feet
    And you are caught in something else

    I can never love
    Anyone enough
    To drag them back from out of hell

    Take another breath
    You'll scare yourself to death
    There's no one here but you and I

    Try and take control
    'Cause you're the only soul
    That fits the hole your head's inside

    No one else can know
    The places that you go
    When you're going down and down (down and down)

    Words cannot explain
    You're in a hurricane
    That keeps you going round and round (round and round)

    I prefer the day
    If we both could stay
    If the sun could rise again

    We'd never know the fear
    That always finds us here
    When the day is at an end

    And you know that there's no one there
    But you still get scared sometimes (sometimes, sometimes)
    And you know that it's in your mind
    Push it right back through the blinds (push it through the blinds)

    And you know that there's no one there
    But you still get scared sometimes (sometimes, sometimes)
    And you know that it's in your mind
    Push it right back through the blinds

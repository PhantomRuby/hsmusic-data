    <i>The Cat Herd:</i>

    413 is here, folks and fellows! And with it, Retcon (2018)!

    A few years ago, [I arranged these tracks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ-rusvmsEs) much like I have today. I expected to be leaving the Homestuck community when the comic ended, yet I'm still here. I'm still here because the tight-knit fandom keeps creating new and wonderful content that keeps me coming back for more.

    So, I took this remnant from my past and gave it life again. I hope you enjoy this album as much as I enjoyed making it. :)

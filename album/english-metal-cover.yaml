   <i>Ash Taylor:</i> ([Bandcamp about blurb](https://estrobiologist.bandcamp.com/track/english-metal-cover))

   ah, homestuck. the story of an incel being so cosmically pissed off that he becomes god and kills everything

   <i>Ash Taylor:</i> ([YouTube description](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzXFNczWBvQ), excerpt)

   every few months i think "why don't i edit together cool videos more often?" and promptly re-learn why i don't fucking edit together cool videos more often. this was so much fucking work

Lyrics: |-
    Shattered windows, broken doors
    Debased masses clamor for more
    Sinking beneath the only law
    Drowning in corruption's jaws
    Degenerate, as the past does
    No design but mine
    No design survives forever
    
    DROWN
    DROWN
    DROWN
    DROWN

Lyrics: |-
    I dig worms out of the ground
    And fish for ancient cities drowned
    The water roils as it shepherds me
    Through a million sunken ecstasies
    I sleep down among the dogs
    See the shores swaddled in fog
    Unless you've been where I have been
    You can't live well in your own skin

Track: Ringlorn
Duration: '04:29'
Lyrics: |-
    On a bench in the park beneath a scarlet glow
    Spend every night in the company of ghosts
    The guests all depart at the end of the show
    Leave you with the things that you wish you could leave the most
    
    Over mountain passes, through valleys and hills
    Far from the furnaces of dark and distant mills
    Shadows shrink back from kerosene lamps
    Down cobblestone paths to caravan camps
    
    A lady wreathed in gold, two raised wands in her hands
    Calls for her children across the shadow covered lands
    The eagle descends from a crack in the sky
    Down to the mist-wrought towns where dreams go to die

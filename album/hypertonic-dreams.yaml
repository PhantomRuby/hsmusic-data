    <i>Redditstuck:</i> ([Bandcamp about blurb](https://redditstuckmusic.bandcamp.com/album/hypertonic-dreams))

    Even in my dreams I see their agents. Stalking the corners of my field of vision beyond what I can clearly observe. An inescapable sinking feeling is present in my gut, as though certain imperceptible forces are slowly, but surely, aligning themselves against me. I do not know how much longer I am fated to survive. Perhaps I only now continue to remain free of them at their whim. In any case, I present this download to you as an act against their demands. Though I may fall you must never give in.

    (I gotta have a good meal, meal, meal, meal, meal, meal...)
    (Garfield, you fat cat.)
    (Jon, it's what I do.)
    (Don't do it, Garfield.)
    (in orbit, you stupid mutt.)

    (You're such a bad kitty that's it, I've had it with you that does it, GAAAAARRRFIIIELD!!!)
    (Enough with the chit-chat, time for a nap.)

    (Jon, you stupid)

    <i>Cristata:</i> ([Bandcamp about blurb](https://web.archive.org/web/20221229220044/https://smoothiefruitee.bandcamp.com/album/perfectly-generic-album), 2022 release, around 12/2/2022)

    The Perfectly Generic Album.

    Originally for the Perfectly Generic Podcast.

    <i>Cristata:</i> ([Bandcamp credits blurb](https://web.archive.org/web/20201110163702/https://smoothiefruitee.bandcamp.com/album/perfectly-generic-album), original release)

    Thank you to the original Homestuck Music Team for inspiring me, and to all the folks in the fandom who wont stop making fan content. You all rock and drive me to make my very best work. Never stop.

    <i>Quasar Nebula:</i> (wiki editor)

    Perfectly Generic Album was removed from Bandcamp and probably delisted from YouTube around July 2021 ([[static:changelog#24-jul-2021|wiki changelog]]), but put back online in November 2022 ([#hsmusic-chat](https://discord.com/channels/749042497610842152/779895315750715422/1041738344121516174)). The updated version of the album does not include [[track:gasters-theme-pga]] ([capture](https://web.archive.org/web/20221229220044/https://smoothiefruitee.bandcamp.com/album/perfectly-generic-album)), which used to be the ninth track ([capture](https://web.archive.org/web/20201110163702/https://smoothiefruitee.bandcamp.com/album/perfectly-generic-album)), between [[track:thought-and-flow-pga]] and [[track:another-noir-extended-void-mix]].

    Listen, if you didn't think I would shoehorn Gaster into this album somehow, you were incredibly, horribly wrong.

   <i>PatManDX:</i> ([Bandcamp about blurb](https://loftlocked.bandcamp.com/album/loftlocked-vol-1))

   This album is a collaboration of people I've managed to fool into thinking that this comic was worth any of their time.

   I'm greatly pleased to present to you 15 great songs (and 2 equally sweet bonus ones). Don't forget to take a gander at the cool track art we've made!

   <i>PatManDX:</i> ([Bandcamp about blurb](https://loftlocked.bandcamp.com/track/flower-child))

   This track was a bit of a big leap for both the composer and the track artist. [[artist:rnd]] decided to experiment with sounds resembling traditional Indonesian Gamelan, whereas [[artist:patmandx|Pat]] had took his first steps into more painted-styled drawings. After some trial and error, both were pleasantly surprised with the result of their work and the work of the other's.

   It was really hot.

   <i>PatManDX:</i> (Discord, 9/20/24)
   honestly it was probably me, sound like me at age 17

   <i>Jebb:</i> (wiki editor, Discord, 9/20/24)
   Lmao

   <i>Lilithtreasure:</i> (wiki editor)

   While Pat may've not remembered if it was him who wrote the commentary for Flower Child; it's mostly likely him given that the other track commentaries are from [[artist:veritas-unae]].

    <i>Veritas Unae:</i> ([Bandcamp about blurb](https://loftlocked.bandcamp.com/track/thunderhead))
    The song is very chaotic, representing a world dominated by an [REDACTED] thunderstorm. I tried to bring a balance between tranquility and complete rage, counterbalancing the world of the player with the player [REDACTED].

    <i>Veritas Unae:</i> ([SoundCloud description, excerpt](https://soundcloud.com/veritasunae/thunderhead))

    I made a song at the request of [[artist:patmandx|Pat]] for his fan adventure, Loftlocked. <i>(Succeeding paragraph same as Bandcamp description, up 'til...)</i>

    I used Sibelius and Pro Tools SE for this.

    <i>Kevin Grant:</i> ([SoundCloud comment](https://soundcloud.com/veritasunae/thunderhead))

    Whoa, people still make HS fanmusic? Is it 2011? Where am I what's going on who are these nice men in the suits taking me away

    <i>Veritas Unae:</i> ([SoundCloud comment](https://soundcloud.com/veritasunae/thunderhead))

    considering people still make HS fanventures... yeah, I guess so. oh wait where are you going oh goodbye friend i hope you enjoy your trip!!

   This song was tricky to nail, but when I got it, I ran with it, leaving its children and significant other behind in a flurry of musical excitement.<br>
   Do you hear those suspended cymbal rolls? DO YOU HEAR THEM???

Commentary: |-
    <i>Quasar Nebula:</i> (wiki editor)

    Positioned as the zeroth track in the album, this has the actual album cover as its cover artwork, so the first track ([[track:the-static-vol-1-3]]) can retain its own artwork without messing with the album's presentation in music players.

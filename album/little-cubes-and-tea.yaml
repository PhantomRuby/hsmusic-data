    This month I wanted to use Mario Paint Composer, but that thing actually sucks really bad, worse than Milkytracker, so instead I yanked the samples from point A to point B and magic has become science, then science got debunked.

    Going back from a tracker to a piano roll editor feels like coming home; not that soft kind of 'finally home after a hard days work', more like 'finally home after a month of camping'. So evidently I did have a vacation away, because the best part of a vacation is coming home.

    I intended this to be a duet between a violin and a square wave, then the square wave became two distinct square waves out of phase, the violin also got pizzicato backup, and claves because claves.

    This was made in a tracker, it's pretty obvious to those with keen hearing; to those with slightly less keen hearing, it wasn't made in Mario Paint Composer, I just extracted the soundbits from the soundfont that came with MPC. To the people with regular hearing, Duke von Whiskerton is now canon.

    This is literally the first song on double tempo.

    Sugar is usually giving an energy rush, so to give the title an energy rush of its own, caffeine was introduced.

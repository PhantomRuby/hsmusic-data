    <i>Toby Fox:</i> ([UNDERTALE / DELTARUNE NEWSLETTER - ISSUE 1 (Winter Season)](https://toby.fangamer.com/newsletters/winter22/), excerpt)

    Pokémon Scarlet and Violet have released! I had the honor of making a few songs for the game: [[track:tera-raid-battle|"Tera Raid Battles"]], the [[track:the-academy-ace-tournament|"Academy Ace Tournament"]], and of course, [[track:battle-zero-lab|"Battle! Zero Lab"]]. I also composed [[track:area-zero|"Area Zero"]], which was re-arranged by my friend [[artist:go-ichinose|Go Ichinose]].

    I also composed a majestic theme melody for the song [[track:the-academy|"Academy"]]. Surprisingly, this ended up used as a field theme for the whole game! Though, all songs using the melody were made by other amazing composers. (I love [[track:a-stroll-through-the-south-province|the soft piano version]] that plays at night.) Anyhow, that's all I did!

    <i>ruby:</i> (wiki editor)

    [[track:celestial]] and [[track:celestial-toby-fox|the Toby Fox remix]] are not on this album.

    <i>Toby Fox:</i> ([UNDERTALE / DELTARUNE NEWSLETTER - ISSUE 1 (Winter Season)](https://toby.fangamer.com/newsletters/winter22/), excerpt)

    I also composed "Area Zero", which was re-arranged by my friend [[artist:go-ichinose]].

    <i>ruby:</i> (wiki editor)

    <img src="media/misc/toby-fox-go-ichinose.gif" width="498" height="374">

    Also, not an actual reference, but the main arpeggio in this song happens to use the same scale as [[track:alphys]]. It's worth pointing out as the songs end up sounding slightly similar.

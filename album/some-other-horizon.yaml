Lyrics: |-
    I've forgotten her face
    I don't remember her voice at all
    What is she to me, anyway?
    Why should I care that I don't recall?

    Well, all my pride was misplaced
    How could I have been so blind
    What use is a memorial in your mind?

    Cups break, windows crack
    Trees die, and don't grow back
    If you wait
    The leaves will all turn black

    And she, too, forgot me
    At last the whole truth has come to light
    It was all just a gambit
    A surrender and not a fight

    And for all those years, she bore my weight, for love, for hate, she tolerated
    Me, abandoned me, a worthless scrap to her, until she died that night
    That endless night

    Cups break, windows crack
    trees die, and don't grow back
    If you wait, the leaves will all turn black

    Don't you know,
    overgrown houses fall
    all they've known, no trace at all
    a bird sends up her morning call
    alone

    I've always known how to make things
    but not how to break them,
    I don't know how to take it
    when they can't be repaired
    I've always known! She's gone,
    she's gone, she's gone, she's gone...
    She never cared

    Who am I, who was I
    to you, my mother? Answer me!

    Cups break, windows crack
    trees die, and don't grow back
    suddenly, everything goes black

    Songs end, seeds decay
    You can't pretend the grief away
    Oh, if I could send a reply with the things I'd like to say
    I'd say I'm sorry, that I wasted my childhood away

    But you're not there
    And you can't watch me
    Destroy this memorial today.

    <i>Raid:</i> ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCJ2Z0HOSLs) description)

    It's April 13!!!! Here's the Homestuck tune you were promised. I present to you Out of Breath, a tune I worked pretty hard on. It's got real electric guitars, a little chiptune intro, some intense drumming, a lot of quoted material from songs I like, and an 80-bar piano solo. There's a LOT of piano in this tune. It's very piano-centric, for reasons apparent to anyone who's ever read the comic.

    This is the first of the three new tracks to be released on my upcoming compilation album of all my old Homestuck music, titled "I Warned You About Stairs". The album will come soon-ish.

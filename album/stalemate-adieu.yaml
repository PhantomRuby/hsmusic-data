    Stalemate had a lot of music in the works when we had to pull the plug on it. But that doesn't mean it has to disappear! Here we have all the music that the team had lined up for future albums, which, unfortunately were never published. Every tracks info has the name of its creator, and a link to their page. Some even have unique album arts.
    
    Songs 1-11 were intended for an album called "Light and Dark", an album meant to highlight the lives of the Trolls and Dryads with character themes and more.
    
    Songs 12-27 were part of a completed album called In Between. Though finished, though its release was pending the end of Act 2. It was similar to homestuck Medium album, filled with wonderful songs about the various lands. In between also included themes for Derse, Prospit, the Horrorterrors, and Skaia.
    
    28-57 is just a general assortment of songs for Volume 3, including some wips.
    
    58 - 60 are songs that a few of the music team members decided to create after the comics end was announced, to say goodbye.
    
    Thank you for listening.
    
    [The creators of the songs have full rights to their music. (and may contact me at any time to have their songs removed from this collection)]

Lyrics: |-
    Everyday is still the same day
    Canons blowing outside my place
    Paperwork, fill more paperwork
    Made just to help her pay for her kingdom
    
    Dumb is what i play outside of music
    And i use it to get away from the nuisance
    To a new place where everyone has equal
    Rights, and are considered as people
    
    Rooks, bishops, knights we all are pawns
    In the same game that goes on and on
    And press is cool,when sunshine glimmers
    Above the dead bodies covered in glitter
    Rooks, bishops, knights we all are pawns
    In the same game that goes on and on
    And press is cool,when sunshine glimmers
    Above the dead bodies covered in glitter
    
    Everyday is still the same way
    Burning passions turns to gray
    I chat with friends when darkness here
    The light blue sky is the only clear
    
    The planet's doomed, we can't go back sooner
    It's the apocalypse and the Ruler's crueler
    Than ever and never there's been such evil endeavor
    Get her while you can! We can all sing together
    
    Rooks, bishops, knights we all are pawns
    In the same game that goes on and on
    And press is cool,when sunshine glimmers
    Above the dead bodies covered in glitter
    Rooks, bishops, knights we all are pawns
    In the same game that goes on and on
    And press is cool,when sunshine glimmers
    Above the dead bodies covered in glitter
    
    Empress is cruel, empress is bitter
    Cause all her gold is just glitter
    Empress is cruel and the sun wont shine
    Above the dead body that will be mine

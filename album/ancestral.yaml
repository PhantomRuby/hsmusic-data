    <i>Josefin B.:</i>
    <b>Special Thanks</b>
    I would like to thank Blackhole for having helped and guided me through this entire process. Couldn't have done it otherwise. Circlejourney for assembling the booklet and thus ensuring there would be one. Everyone who jumped in at a second's notice when I needed a track done. Everyone at the LoFaM team for having helped me and for managing a lot if not all the final workload. It's been fun.
    <i>Rangzhe:</i>
    As it is the cover of the album, I wanted to make it dramatic as much as to my ability. I wanted to put them in order of the zodiac at first but I realized that it didn't look as great, so I put the Signless and his associates as one and the other highbloods on the other side, and to show the Handmaid vs Condesce I made them top and bottom, as polar opposites. I felt like this was the best way to put them to show their interactions in the stories. The background was inspired by the actaul Homestuck album "Alternia" and the pixel-y title font is also because of the ancestor's role to prepare the descendants for the game.
    <i>Josefin B.:</i>
    To some extent, I consider Ancestral to be a little sister album to [[album:beforus]]. We share many contributors and this project was largely inspired by Beforus. The reason we asked Rangzhe to make our cover was to tie it in. The very last track of Beforus, [[Motions of Infinity]], ending with the ancestors being created, was drawn by her. Isn't it fitting how she begins this story after having ended the last? That, and her art is hella.

    <i>Corona Sanctus:</i>
    This track was written with fairytales and myths regarding the troll ancestors in mind. I tried to give it a fairytale-y feel.
    <i>Rebecca Peason:</i>
    I was thinking about how I could include all twelve trolls in a picture that sort of introduced them in a sense. The organ sounding bit in the song made me think "rose window" and, of course, the only direction given to the artist who made the Ancestor silhouettes for the showdown flashes: "Heavy handed religious imagery."

    <i>Navochao:</i>
    Continuing my trend of using a flute in every single song I've written, I bring you Reality Theatre!
    This song kind of creeps me out and I'm not sure if that's good or bad.
    I hope you enjoy this song that can only be described as a trip.
    <i>Prince:</i>
    The story of the Handmaid is one of long drawn out sorrow and pain. But she was also a powerful being responsible for dealing with some of Lord English's worst demands. I wanted to accurately portray her character in my track art: someone lonely and pained, but still had some sort of power and magic to her. She's a fearsome foe for what it's worth. In my art, I posed the handmaid to look distant from the viewer, but still her eyes are sharp and her stance is ready to attack. Who knows what she will do when she strikes.

Lyrics: |-
    (I have thought of the summoner often. I have been troubled to know that as one so common blooded, he could not possibly have been hatched yet, nor will he wriggle from the caverns for many sweeps. So I must have patience to take my role in his story of heroism. It is a tale which reads to me as though lifted from a child's story, yet, I know I'd be a fool to doubt its veracity entirely. He would rise through the ranks of the cavalreapers and assume command, having proven the most skilled and fearless of them. He would exhibit a remarkable pupation, the sort only recorded in myth, growing, or perhaps simply revealing, a striking pair of wings. His army thus inspired would spearhead a major rebellion. Surely one at least on the scale of the sectarian revolt crushed by the Highbloods, who thereafter forbade its mention, or any invocation of the heretical symbols at all, even in private journals. Which is why I will stick to the fable of the summoner, and not risk another execution with even oblique reference to the compelling tale of the sufferer.)
Commentary: |-
    <i>irl-porrim-maryam:</i>
    I was absolutely ecstatic when I was given the track of the Summoner! Though there's not much canon information on him, towards the end I was able to include an excerpt from [Page 3758](https://www.homestuck.com/story/3758), in which Midnfang journals about the Summoner. I also looked to [[Bronze Rebel]] from coloUrs and mayhem and [[♉ - Breathtak1ng]] from the Beforus Album to get a feel on what instruments I should be using. I gave the song a bit more of a minor key since the Summoner's life most likely wasn't the easiest or most fun life to lead. This track was definitely great fun to work on, and I'm definitely honoured to be a part of the Ancestral Album!
    <i>Molly:</i>
    I quite like how this piece came out! The track itself was lovely and soothing, and the vocals at the end added an interesting feeling to it, almost like a story book. I wanted to showcase the atmosphere rather than The Summoner directly, but still wanted it to be obvious that this is The Summoner's track, and a view point from behind where you can obviously see his defining caharacteristics but not directly see his face felt like the best way to accomplish that! That, and a purple and blue night sky above the rust-blooded Summoner, with a golden fire in front of him feels rather poetic ina way. This was definitely a learning experience, and a really fun piece to work on for the album. I'm excited to see what's next!

    <i>Sean William Calhoun:</i>
    When I was asked to fill in four the Psiioniic's track, I wanted to make a nod to First Turn Fold's [[Gold Pilot]], given my history with it. So, while I did not quote any full theme from Gold Pilot, several elements are a little bit like it.
    <i>Dogslug:</i>
    The Psiioniic is without ad oubt my favorite character in Homestuck, and this song is absolutely perfect for him. The whole song, but especially the glitchy sounding parts, make me think of him losing himself in the Helm, losing everything that he was and is and what's left of his past can be just as painful as his present.

Commentary: |-
    <i>Nate Tronerud:</i>
    Cursed with visions of a better Alternia, one of love and peace, the Signless walks ever forward. Visions of such a world may bring to Him great pain, but also great hope: it is a ÷orld worth striving for, one He could possibly see in His own lifetime, and so He continues walking. He spreads the message of such a world knowing it will fall on mostly deaf ears, even met with hostility. But for the chance to bring love and happiness to even a single troll, it fills Him; His suffering is worth it, even if it means making the ultimate sacrifice in the name of peace...
    <i>Lilly Higgs:</i>
    I wanted to experiment a little with this one! And great apologies to Austin Wintory and the whole team who worked on Journey by That Game Company. This song seemed very lonely, very solitary, so I envisioned the Signless wandering through the dunes between city and township of people who won't listen, lit by the light of two moons, but only remembering one.

Commentary: |-
    <i>The One Music Maniac:</i>
    "On The Hunt For Something Unknown" is not about the events that took place within the Disciple's lifetime, but rather how these events allowed her to define who she became: a Warrior, a Lover, and a Survivor. The overall title is a play on her cat-like survival skills, while the definition of "unknown" can be led to open interpretation-- a love beyond quadrants, equality in a society that's built upon an oppression of hierarchy, etc.
    <i>Melissa Peebles:</i>
    For this song I pictured people gathered around a fire late into the night listening to fables, the beat and thrill of a hunt, and the undefinable love between Disciple and Signless echoed in the heartbeat at the end. This track defines Disciple beautifully and I wanted to show who she had become through symbolism.

    (THROUGH FIRE, JUSTICE IS SERVED!)
Commentary: |-
    <i>SerialSymphony:</i>
    Theotokos is about how the Dolorosa saw the Signless growing up, his sermons and execution, and ends with a look forward to his descendant. Making this song was like making a premix brownie cake; I love brownie cakes. But you can't just make a brownie cake, you gotta eat it too.
    Thusly, this song is delicious.
    <i>shu:</i>
    I love how this track starts off so sweet, builds up steadily, then falls back again. There's so much happening; it was very difficult to pick a single snapshot// I just hope I was able to do this magnificently dynamic piece a little justice!

Commentary: |-
    <i>Seren Mist:</i>
    When I was assigned to write Redglare's main track for the album, my first thought was to make it a very orchestral track, with lots of strings. As it was forming, I decided that limiting myself to only orchestral instruments would hamper my exploration of her character, so I added in more synth sounds and heavier drums. The name of the track comes from a play on "His Honorable Tyrrany" and from a quote by Alexander Pope, "On wrongs swift vengeance waits." I think it's quite fitting for Redglare, who blindsides Mindfang but in the name of justice, of course.
    <i>Liz Fish:</i>
    This track inspired me to put a noir twist on my usual style. I could picture Redglare stalking down dirty back alleys and seedy underground establishments, hunting down the fleeing criminals that need to be brought to JUST1C3 in a gritty detective game with cyberpunk flavor. A great track and a great character; I hope I've done justice for them both. >:]

Lyrics: |-
    Walk the gangway, look right through me,<br>Take it my way, no one's duty.<br>Trust my dice cast, where the wind falls,<br>Fortune's eye glass, scattered light shoals.
    Fires burning 'cross the ocean,<br>Fate is turning, starboard motion.<br>Now an outcast, dreams of dying<br>Foretold at last, waking, flying.
Commentary: |-
    <i>Blackhole:</i>
    This song took me a while to finish off, but it's finally here! At 10 minutes it is the longest singular piece I've ever composed. I tried to take inspiration from different Mindfang themes and parts of her story to get a rounded depiction of her character, while keeping an overarching theme for her throughout.
    <i>Josefin B.:</i>
    I've been working a lot with Blackhole lately and they've really helped me out a lot with this album, so I wanted to collab right from the start. There's not much to tell; it's Mindfang looking good and probably being nasty. It's fully made with aquarelle and I never want to ever see her hair again.

    <i>psithurist:</i>
    This track is about Darkleer and his fall from his position of E%ecutor. 'toe' were a big influence for me on this. They're a math rock band, so I wrote it in 15/8 because it sounds awkward, just like the Zahhaks. The title is a pun on bow and instrument strings.
    <i>Phil Gibson:</i>
    One of the absolte best character arcs in HS is Darkleer and Equius - both succumbing to their own desires to tragic ends, but for the greater good of the story. It's a heavy bittersweet taste, but one I love enough to make them my favorite characters.

    <i>Zan Beaver:</i>
    The Grand Highblood,<br>He is the enforcer,<br>He is the ruler,<br>He is the one they fear.<br>But why do they fear?<br>His unmatched tyranny?<br>His capricious pardons?<br>They do not know,<br>And they fear to know,<br>Because anyone who knows,<br>Becomes a part of His Demented Mural.
    So yeah, The Grand Highblood. Pretty scary guy, right? Anyways, that short sort-of poem is the best way I can portray my thought process while making this. It starts off with an eerie organ and piano representing the dread anyone would feel from having to confront him. It speeds up to represent his violent nature, and the many repetitions embody his cruel insanity. The few sections of the piece that show glimmers of hope are soon shot down and brought back to vicious hopelessness.
    <i>Amanda Bell:</i>
    The title of the track I did work for was called "His Demented Mural". Besides the painting he keeps behind his throne, I also imagined his face paint to be a part of that. Changing everyday to match each addition to the wall behind him.

Commentary: |-
    <i>Seijen:</i>
    So this is a re-hash of one of my first tracks from about 2 and a half years ago. The original title of the track was "Robot Pirate Island" and had a shift into a ravecore EDM as opposed to the constant high energy baroque sound we have here. This current edit is from april of 2016. I would create another, had it not been for the project crashing upon loading. It sounds incredibly rough in comparison to my current skill and I'm losing a little sleep over it. A damn shame since the amount of tools and knowledge I have now could make this sound night and day in quality, but what you hear is what you get.
    <i>Sigourney Martin:</i>
    While working on this piece, the song wasn't difficult per-say? It was more challenging, because I had many different images on how I wanted this to look like. In the end, I chose what I drew and it was fun! I tried watercolours (though it might not be noticable) and I think it turned out alright!

    With disc 2 I wanted a more violent, powerful feel to assimilate the feeling of terror all the battles the ancestors fought
    <i>Rebecca Peason:</i>
    I wanted the Disc two piece to be related to the first in that it showed the wear and tear their actual lives had on them. Where they ended up, how they died, what happened, etc. Signless is completely smashed out of the window as if he never existed, a few of the panels are modified, but some have holes smashed through them, indicating their deaths in one way or another. Just as this disc is meant to be the story of the Ancestors, I wanted this track's art to reflect that in comparison to the first disc's.

    <i>Rhyselinn:</i>
    Ancestral Anthem is a big huge medley of Homestuck tunes! It loosely tells the timeline of the ancestors and the shenanigans that they went through.
    The motifs used, in order--
    - [[Alternia]]
    - [[Darling Dolorosa]] + [[Iron Infidel]]
    - [[track:olive-scribe]] + [[Gold Pilot]]
    - [[Jade Mother]]
    - [[Indigo Heir]]
    - [[Cobalt Corsair]]
    - [[Violet Prince]] + [[Purple Bard]]
    - [[Bronze Rebel]] + [[The Lost Child]]
    - [[The Lost Child]] + [[track:fuchsia-ruler]]
    then each of the tunes of the album played in hemospectrum order, followed by a reprise of Alternia.
    So all in all, it's a medley of 26 songs! It's one of the more ambitious projects I've taken in recent memory, and it took me a number of months to complete, but I had a blast doing it! I hope you guys enjoy it :smile:
    <i>bootsie:</i>
    I greatly enjoyed working on this piece. I'm so proud of all the work that's gone into this project and it's been an honor to participate.

Commentary: |-
    <i>Seren Mist:</i>
    This track gave me room to explore, as the only thing we know about this event is that it had to have happened. I decided to make it a very absolute battle theme, with a tension-building lead up and a main body with lots of leading synth. The end with the brass is meant to end on a note of bittersweet, because the Batterwitch has won this battle, but what will that mean for the rest of the universe?
    <i>Shellsea:</i>
    Capturing such a profound moment proved to be somewhat challenging, balancing struggle, triumph, and condescension all in one piece. The process of creating such a proud and arrogant face of victory washed over by the shadows of an unforeseeable future was very fun, eagerly claiming the crown for her own, for better of or for worse.

    <i>Mathias Ramalho:</i>
    This is a track made for the Grand Highblood, a short track reflecting his own traits and personality, just to tell you how good he is at his job.
    <i>Kisbys:</i>
    Since the track was for the Grand Highblood and centered around his job and traits, I decided to try and make something that would reflect that. I drew him in a situation where he is getting ready to take care of his usual business: culling some trolls. The song sounded powerful so I wanted to try and portray the GHB that way too by drawing him much larger than the trolls in the foreground. There are some silhouettes of other trolls in the background which are the other subjuggulators. I added some of my own headcanons for what I like to imagine he dresses like and kept it relatively simple, as well as trying to add as much color to the image as I could. He's also looking outwards and the viewpoint is that of someone in the crowd of trolls that are about to be culled, so it can be taken as a "you're next" type scenario. Truly I just tried to create a piece that represented what the music made me envision and feel, and I hope I could do the lovely song some justice!

    <i>Acyl:</i>
    A variation of Eridan's Theme from AlterniaBound, written more sombre for his ancestor. I was originally going to add lyrics and make a shanty, but the instrumental alone sounded perfect. Dualscar is always portrayed loud and angry so I quieted the mood.
    <i>YoItsCro:</i>
    This piece was really intersting to try out. I was experimenting with a way of painting over everything rather than just staying within the comfort zone of line art. I think for the most part it worked out. Considering the song literally had wave sounds in it, I'd figure to put Dualscar near an ocean as well. The song parallels Eridan's theme too, so I thought I'd set a callback to when he took down a whale of his own. Dualscar's a messy shot thoug, which is why he's probably cleaning the spill off his gun.

    this track started out as a rough ambient piece, with dissonant piano and beating drums. like each new page of mindfang's journal, more layers found their way in to complete the picture. much like her, this track is unsettling and restless.
    <i>Silverwater:</i>
    A music that you can imagine of Mindfang's destiny with the ancestor from start til the end, awesome!

    <i>Nate Tronerud:</i>
    The Dolorosa makes the fateful decision to abandon the mother grub and care for the mutant anomaly, the Signless, setting into motion events far beyond her understanding, ones that will have far reaching consequences, even beyond her own timeline. The music begins as the ramifications of her decision quickly begin to unfold, following not just her efforst to keep the Signless safe on the surface, but the broader implications that her choice set in motion. The gears begin to turn...

    <i>Tunapuns:</i>
    in this track i wanted to draw something to fit the more intense parts of the music, so i drew the dolorsa maybe on the run and fleeing from danger while trying to protect a child signless with a bright fiery light source for contrast!

    This is a song about before the Disciple met the Signless. I'd imagine that she might have lived a life like Nepeta, far from society in the wild and carefree.
    <i>Sigourney Martin:</i>
    While listening to this song, I kind of thought of her looking out on a town or city, maybe feeling like an outcast of some sort. Maybe listening to the Signless's sermons from the distance but not really going to them herself.

    <i>David Burkee:</i>
    When I was composing PRII2M BREAK, what kept coming to mind were some songs I had been listening to a few months back while I was cramming for finals. It was pretty much elevator music on crack, so moderately calming at times but then some speed segments. That's what I tried to do here with the saws and NES drums for the energetic parts. I feel like I pulled off a very bipolar retelling of the Psiioniic's internal struggles.
    <i>Andi DiSpirito:</i>
    Upon escaping, the Psii must have struggled with respecting his leader's pacifism when given the chance to strike back for once in his life. I wanted to show the split second when adrenaline is at the helm and the Signless' words are the only thing keeping him from blasting you moonside.

    <i>Nevaeh Drexler:</i>
    I wanted to have lots of flute, piano, and violin in this piece. Piano from [[Serenade]] from Vol. 8 and [[Requited]] from Vol. 9; both Leijon themed songs. Flute and violin from [[track:olive-scribe]]; The Disciple's 'canon theme'. My main inspiration for the Disciple's New Beginning was Requited, since it's a song about the love between The Disciple and The Signless. Since The Disciple's New Extreme is about The Disciple meeting and falling in love with Signless, Requited was my go-to music fuel.
    <i>Gilwing:</i>
    Requited is a very special song to me, so I'm very thankful I got to do the art for this track. Everything about Disciple meeting Signless and falling in love is pretty up in the air in canon, so I came up with my own version of their first encounter, under the light of Alternia's moons.

    <i>TempiTunes:</i>
    Okay so this piece is about the Signless and co. I used inspiration from varying songs on the canon Homestuck soundtrack, mostly from coloUrs and mayhem: Universe A. You may recognize bits from [[Jade Mother]], [[Iron Infidel]], [[Gold Pilot]], [[Requited]] from Homestuck Vol. 8 and something like [[Nepeta's Theme]] from AlterniaBound. The narrative of the song follows the Dolorosa, Signless, Disciple, and Psiioniic as they get together and meet each other.
    This is by far the most complicated track I've ever composed and I'm pretty proud of it. There are about seven instruments and over ten parts. I hope you enjoy!
    <i>Erin B.:</i>
    There's so much to this "family's" story and so much from the song that I really love. The trick comes to showing a alrge story in a single image. Luckily, the very tone of the song seemed to lead to the idea of stained glass windows. So I tried to create one to display the moments of this family coming together.

    I was excited to get a Signless/Sufferer track for my assignment, and even more so when the song focused more on his life and deeds than his death. He may not have succeeded in his ultimate goals, but his actions and words gave amny trolls hope and irrevocably changed Alternia.

    From the Handmaid's perspective as she wreaks havoc on Altertnia. This was made a few months after my other track, [[track:leftovers-ancestral]], so I'm a little more confident with my voice here. There's a brief sample from [[Temporal Shenanigans]] by Rachel Rose Mitchell.
    <i>Josefin B.:</i>
    I wanted to do a Handmaid piece since the album started, but never really got the chance. Then psi swooped in with this track, and I jumped on it. I had actually another design in mind but ultimately the song was too aggressive for that. Unfortunately, I didn't have enough time for colour so when the lineart was done, I outsourced it to Andi, who did an absolutely stsellar job. The majykks crackle is all theirs.

Commentary: |-
    <i>Nymelord:</i>
    When I was tasked with creating a song about Darkleer becoming the expatriate, I thought to myself; "What if the opening of this song sounded kind of eerie because it would be Darkleer walking to execute the Sufferer?" And after that I just let the plot take me to Signless dying, and the whole "Executioner-to-Expatriate" thing.
    <i>Donomon:</i>
    When I first listened to the March I was overcome with this sense of burden of duty and formality. It has this really deliberate vibe, but it's so forlorn in its conclusion. After reading the composer's commentary I really wanted to capture that feeling of Darkleer both walking to and away from his duty, so I thought the marching boots would be a nice visual metaphor for that. The void is depicted as rising up to envelop him and his weapons from the stain of blood at his feet. I hope I did this track justice!

Commentary: |-
    <i>not-the-kind-you-save:</i>
    A song about the death of troll jegus requires a certain amount of drama, which is nothing big orchestral chords can't fix. The lyrics are a combination of things the Signless is thinking to himself and "saying" to the people around him, in particular Darkleer. I wanted to create a sense of urgency, and the feeling that while the Signless is saying over and over that he doesn't care if he dies, he may be lying. Musically, I wanted to portray a since of racing thoughts, which means there isn't really a conventional song structure. The vocals are echoey for <i>~aesthetic~</i>. Enjoy!
    <i>Oskarna:</i>
    This song marks the end of the Signless' life, encapsulating what would have been his last thoughts and words. I wanted to portray the sort of emptiness that happens after he has gotten his wish, and show the mark he leaves even in death.

    <i>keyboard cait:</i>
    Like a few other tracks on this album, this was a last-minute emergency song made for a track that was dropped. The very title of this track is also lifted from the original submission. Though it was in a roundabout way, I'm glad I got to contribute to the album with a brand new piece!
    This particular song features a lot of piano, owing to its predecessor's status as a solo piano composition. However, I thought some mournful strings would also represent the idea of Darkleer's exile well, and their slow, dark nature under the main piano melody expresses the shame and confusion he must have felt the entire time. It's hard being a highblood and expressing a sudden act of kindness that gets you ostracized from every upper caste, wrecks your social standing and upends your entire way of life. It's hard and nobody understands.
    <i>Xagave:</i>
    This made me think of Darkleer's life in general so here he is, standing proud and doing his job, and then his slouched form bemoaning his existence after being banished.

Lyrics: |-
    I wrote once in a book, ancient record I kept<br>Of a Hero whose story they wish you'd furget<br>A legacy I fought to purrtect<br>Of a signless seer burdened by Blood and dreams of an impawsible past
    And so it is known, in a world enslaved by Rage,<br>He alone defied her throne, he had faith in a better way
    Delicate lines writ on delicate pages,<br>measuring lives to be known through the ages<br>Efury word that he spoke, I wrote<br>I always lent him my ear, his dear Disciple
    In word and in action, he taught love and compassion<br>and equality despite blood, caste, or faction<br>In whispers he roared with a burning passion<br>But no Hero's tail is complete without a villain, without a tragedy
    And so it is told, from his words arose outrage,<br>The peace he furtold inspired a challenge, inspired a change
    Delicate lines writ on delicate pages,<br>measuring lives to be known through the ages<br>Efury word that he spoke, I wrote<br>I always lent him my ear, his dear Disciple
    And when the Time came when they called fur his name,<br>they cried fur his blood and they put him to shame<br>They branded him heretic, cast him in irons<br>without Hope, a lamb at the mercy of lions<br>His love and compassion burned bright as the shackles,<br>the scarlet-soaked ground became his tabernacle<br>To speak one final word, one Final Sermon...
    Now these despurrate lines scrawled on a canvas of caves<br>measure his life in a pallet of pain<br>The final curse that he cried I remember<br>His suffuring's branded on my Heart furever<br>A new sign we did take from the ash of his shame<br>to remember his strife and hallow his name<br>Efuryone he once loved was condemned,<br>but I vow his words won't disappear,<br>written in ink, traced in blood, sealed with tears,<br>his legacy I'll keep through the years, his dear Disciple
    I wrote once in a book, ancient record I kept,<br>of a Hero whose story I purray you will never furget
Commentary: |-
    <i>aeolianChemist:</i>
    Legacy is written in the voice of the Disciple, reflecting on the story of the Signless and her role within it. Musical inspiration for the song came largely from PhemieC's fansongs and [[track:olive-scribe]] (from coloUrs and mayhem: Universe A). Composing it was a journey in itself; along the way she taught me a lot about her history, her undying dedication, and storytelling. She had so much to say, it was difficult to limit myself to such a concise song. Eahc line has been frequently rewritten, reconsidered, and countless have been cut - I was making revisions up until the final recording.
    In the end, I hope the story you hear is the one she wanted to tell.
    <i>Rangzhe:</i>
    I wanted to express the bittersweet ending of Disciple and Signless' relationship, and how even though she's still trying to move on she looks back, reminiscing the moments.

    <i>WC:</i>
    The idea I wanted to convey with this piece is the subtle melancholy in the Psiioniic who becomes a living battery, but not overly sad or regretful. This was achieved through use of chimes and snare drums which are usually associated with mituna or the Psiioniic. It's a bit more full of energy at the beginning, but loses said energy over time. I'd imagine that gaining unwanted immortality from the Condesce would eventually cause his job to lose the dramatics and emotions over a period of decades or maybe even centuries.
    <i>gelasticat:</i>
    I based the composition of the picture on the adjacent notes on the opposite ears with the two most prominent figures in the Psiioniic's life. I also used what the musician said about him losing his emotions over time to decide on the colours, bright and lively and warm for the main figure then darker an dcolder in the background.

Commentary: |-
    <i>Dallas Ross Hicks:</i>
    Of all the Homestuck pieces I've done, this was one of the most challenging! Not because of the technical difficulty but because of the subject matter: Dolorosa is a tragic figure and her sad fate was entirely undeserved.
    This song opens shortly after the passing of the signless; the four chimes signal his loss and the sad flute her grief. This continues into the arrival of Marquise Spinneret Mindfang: someone Dolorosa may have initially hoped would provide a safer refuge but Mindfang had her own plans for the political prisoner. While the potential for a red relationship between the two was hinted at, it certainly began with empathetic possession which is explored in the second movement of the song: Dolorosa struggles but eventually falls under Mindfang's spell. Darker sounds speak of that despair and when Mindfang finally lets her be, she feels more alone and empty than ever, wishing for someone to come and set her free. Unfortunately, she gets her wish - at the hands of Orphaner Dualscar who frees her of her very existence, solely to spite his soon-to-be former kismesis. The six bell chiems as she passes away echo the beginning of the song and the end of her son.
    Like many of my songs, it is in 6/8 time: Maryams being the sixth troll on the hemospectrum, Serkets the eighth while the snare drum at the end makes eleven hits to represent Ampora. It's a "dark mirror" to [[Dear Heart]] but follows the sad canon story told by Mindfang's journal. I hope you found I did this unfortunate chapter of the Ancestors' story justice.
    <i>Oskarna:</i>
    The death of the Signless marks the beginning of a very different chapter of the Dolorosa's story, and this song does a wonderful job setting the tone for it. I wanted to focus on her initial emptiness - the instigator of this chapter of the Ancestral tale.

Lyrics: |-
    First things first she says your name<br>You gotta hear it to believe it and it gets in your grain<br>You think "uh oh, she's the one"<br>There's hate in her eye and it's turning you on
    You haven't really met her, you don't know her<br>She's a black box<br>One controlling mind, when she talks it's<br>Hopeless, helpless, hate cascades<br>Before you even know it you've been taken up in spades
    I am royalty, not prone to jealousy<br>But<br>In this case I think my head's gone up in<br>Flames of something I can't place<br>I saw the look on the slave girl's face
    Who does she think she is--she's a riot<br>If I tell her we're done she'd deny it<br>The only thing left for her to do is run<br>It's a black-rom rom-com if you've ever seen one
    I'll find her<br>Don't know where<br>But she'll know what a broken heart feels like<br>When she's staring down Ahab's Crosshairs
    Sorry, did I miss the boat?<br>I am realizing slowly, quickly I have<br>Fallen for her crossways, what a joke
    You always hear those stories about<br>Someone you don't know and they say that<br>Hate and love don't mix, like water and oil<br>The blood just floats
    I have never had a strong sense of humor<br>I get off on rumors everywhere I go that she has<br>Gone to the east, or the west, or to hell<br>No matter where, I know her well
    It's sad that it should end like this<br>One of us will leave this dead<br>It's not my fault she struck me when she knew our black was red
    I'll find her<br>Don't know where<br>But she'll know what a broken heart feels like<br>When I send the clown after her head
Commentary: |-
    <i>not-the-kind-you-save:</i>
    I wanted to write something that was basically the antithesis of what we know about Dualscar's personality, at least musically speaking. It ended up being something approaching a rap (I can't rap so I sang it instead). It's Dualscar's justification to hisemlf that he's in the right when it comes to his relationship with Mindfang, and it goes all the way through his clown-ridden demise. Enjoy!
    <i>Lou Chastain:</i>
    Tried replacing Mindfang with a little more Highblood instead. I wanted to kind of focus on that last part while the ships in the background is for Dualscar and Mindfang. It's a bit vague since the different hues of purple mix.

    Court of Miracles was such an amazing track to be able to work on! Admittedly, it was more piecing bits and portions of songs together that I thought would fit GHB's character.

    <i>Acyl:</i>
    I was originally going to make the song more dynamic and pompous but I realized that the furious, almost frantic section in the strings better represented Dualscar in his last moments. True, he may not have shown that on the outside, but his inner turmoil and betral by Mindfang is more important.
    I quoted part of [[Purple Tyrant]] from "coloUrs and mayhem: Universe A" to represent His Honorable Tyranny, and the echoing church organs to show when he takes back control of the situation.
    <i>Liz Fish:</i>
    Dualscar's exact end is left am ystery, only hinted at by Mindfang's memoirs. I have a feeling no one saw his death coming until the last moment, the Orphaner least of all. The track's frenetic build gave me a sense of the kind desperation he was feeling at that point, and how his short sighted mistake cost him everything.

Commentary: |-
    <i>The One Music Maniac:</i>
    "Paint The Walls" is a composition that reflects on the faith-driven andviolent nature of The Grand Highblood. Its instrumentation and distortion is meant to represent the iconic image of The Grand highblood in his throne where the walls surrounding him are painted in troll blood (hence the title of the piece). The ambient break is meant to portray the idealisms that the Makara family holds-- that there is a Mirthful Messiah, guiding them to cause their violent tendencies.
    <i>Melissa Peebles:</i>
    I too wanted to allude to the GHB in the throne room. The music break in the distortion and hard riffs has an almost spiritual feeling and I wanted to illustrate the faith driven side of the GHB; so here he is seen covered in blood and almost reverent.

    <i>Thiefofstars:</i>
    The track definitely gives a strong sense of Redglare's determination and sense of justice, so I went for a composition that put her front and centre.
    I kept the background fairly dark with this ominous silhouette of the gallows, but made Redglare's red + teal colours really bright to make her stand out.

Commentary: |-
    <i>Circlejourney:</i>
    This track is a musical depiction of the showdown between Marquise Spinneret Mindfang and Neophyte Redglare. The piece begins with a driving electric guitar riff representing Mindfang as she sets out on the oceans to meet her foe. Mindfang's motif is interrupted by Redglare's harpsichord as she approaches. As the two clash, both instruments and motifs do battle, fighting to gain the upper hand in the arrangement.
    <i>Lilly Higgs:</i>
    This track is so full of energy!! I wanted to convey that with a dynamic, confrontational (haha) composition set at an angle. Given Mindfang and Redglare's uh, charged relationship and energy, I wanted them to be close, with hot, palpable tension that doesn't ever really get fulfilled. Redglare's about to wallop Mindfang a good one at the same time as she's about to reach her glowing dice, all wrapped in the burning embers of her fleet. If you look closely, you can see the Sufferer's sign swinging around Redglare's neck like a noose.

    <i>Circlejourney:</i>
    This track is about Redglare and her lusus Pyralspite, apprehending the enemies of justice, preserving order in the empress' name. We wanted the track to evoke an image of the pair flying over a battlefield, laying waste to foes. We decided an epic orchestral sound would be most fitting.
    <i>SerialSymphony:</i>
    I think that this song is a vital addition to the dragon genre of music that I feel is severely underrepresented in the Homestuck fan albums. Also, the real reason we used a koto is because neither of us wanted harpsichords.
    <i>Lou Chastain:</i>
    It was difficult making the art as epic as the music while keeping it simple. Still, I did my best to make them both look mighty in a way. Could've focused more on Pyralspite.

    <i>SerialSymphony:</i>
    The demise follows a slowed down piano arrangement of [[Terezi's Theme]], it cresecendos hard, and then almost peters out, which is the style I wanted to show the abrupt end of the Neophyte. I chose the name to mimic a sort of Victorian headline, I'm not sure why, but it fits so well.<br>-Skip
    <i>Daisy S.:</i>
    The art was inspired by religious art due to the dramatic crescendo and haunting tones depicting the abrupt death of Neophyte Redglare. The music combined with the Neophyte's hanging reminded me of some sort of ascension which I wanted to show with the halo and her outstretched hands.

    It's quiet—disturbing<br>I can still hear her cry<br>He was only a lowblood<br>He was always going to die

    It is my legacy<br>My rightful place<br>In the glimmer of the moons<br>But my body is empty<br>Moonlight bleaches<br>Mechanical bones
    Wander off<br>It's a terrible place<br>I have made myself a castle<br>To hold my disgrace
    Who am I kidding?<br>I belong alone<br>There is nothing for me elsewhere<br>And this my home

    (Chorus) x2
Commentary: |-
    <i>not-the-kind-you-save:</i>
    I was tasked with writing a song about Darkleer's thoughts and feelings as he exiles himself post not-killing the Disciple, which is great because my specialty is making things sad.
    The lyrics show Darkleer agonizing over his decision and narrating his emotions, but I wanted to make sure that the tone of the music itself was never really comical--his pain is Serious Business. Unlike many Homestuck songs, this one isn't particularly electronic-sounding, and I think it feels almost like a woe-is-me song from a musical. Hope you enjoy!
    <i>Amanda Bell:</i>
    For this piece I wanted to amplify the melancholy and regret that Darkleer feels after he lets the Disciple go after the Sufferer's execution. The comic only touches base with this moment briefly, so I was happy to work alongside such a great piece that extends on that particular time.

    <i>The One Music Maniac:</i>
    "Summon the Cavalreapers" captures and invokes not only the strength of the Cavalreapers as an army, but also of the loyalty that regined between them and their leader, The Summoner. Because of their devout loyalty and trust, not only did they come together to become the most powerful army, but they became the most powerful rebellious movement that ever lived up to the Signless' name.
    <i>Andi DiSpirito:</i>
    The part of the Summoner's story that I regret not having the chance to see was the moment he first revealed his wings to the crowd. After all, it must take a truly impressive sight to inspire an entire army to follow one into a revolution.

    <i>Elanor Pam:</i>
    What manner of havoc did the summoner wreak, for the Condesce to take such unreasonable measures against a new insurrection? YOu'd think he put the Empress in more of a precarious position than the Sufferer himself ever did...

    <i>Navochao:</i>
    Mindfang wouldn't want a funeral march, she'd want something much more epic.
    The song title is taken from the name of Assasin's Creed Four. The game is titled Black Flag, but after these events it's going to be a bit more blue.
    <i>Thiefofstars:</i>
    I loved the title of this track and the strong visual image it evoked, so I went with quite a literal interpretation for the track art. The music is very strong and bold, and I wanted the art to reflect that same majestic vibe; it's sort of this idea that Mindfang isn't afraid of death, and that she is going out with her head held high. To help give it that feeling I used a fairly dark colour scheme, and (of course) a lot of blue tones.

Commentary: |-
    <i>Seren Mist:</i>
    Since the Summoner's death isn't described in canon, I had a lot of free reign in this piece. I took the veiw that after the Summoner's rebellion was crushed, he was captured and executed by the Condesce. This piece chronciles his last speech (given bravely on his execution platform), his death, and the Condesce's attempt to suppress the rebellion. The low harp at the end is meant to signify how the story of the Summoner and his army survived in hushed stories.
    <i>Kisbys:</i>
    I wanted to try to merge a few elements into this to capture ore of the song. I attempted to show the destruction of the rebellion through the flag by showing it as getting more worn down and ruined as it tapers off. To the left of the image I wanted to show the Summoner giving his speech while in chains, signifying his capture, and to the right I drew one of his camps being attacked and burned to the ground. I wanted it to be like the Condesce sending out armies to crush the camps and thus putting a stop to his rebellion.

    <i>Ducky Senpai:</i>
    This song is meant to depict the Helmsman's demise as he pushes himself to death powering the Condesce's ship. Of course, lots of electronic sounds for a thematic Helmsman track. Sorta tried to vaguely emulate old console noise percussion like on the Commodore 64. SOmehow old tech sound always gives a more "techy" vibe when applied to this kind of music in my opinion.
    <i>shu:</i>
    This track is busy and fast-paced so I tried to capture that with this piece and, in keeping with the "techy" vibe, threw on some static texture. Hopefully the effects distract from the lack of shading because I was worried that it'd be too cluttered!

    The Doom of the Planets is about Her Imperious Condescension's relationship with the Helmsman throughout her interplanetary conquest. Grandiose orchestral snippets are interspersed with intimate, sometimes dissonant contrapuntal segments featuring motifs from [[Gold Pilot]] and [[track:fuchsia-ruler]]. Eventually the various disparate moods of the piece unite at the climax of the piece, signifying the ship's final leap through the cosmos, which ends in theHelmsman's death, the music fading way as his life does.
    <i>Tunapuns:</i>
    oh gosh i really like this song, especially the more orchestral parts. i tried to depict the condesce walking away from the helmsman as he bleeds out to death on the ship and looking all sinister and dark, as the doom of planets should be, and yet making it colorful to match the very prominent track:fuchsia-ruler tune. i have no idea how to describe music so pardon me if i got anything wrong!

    <i>Grace Medley:</i>
    Shortly before finishing the album, this project's coordinator approached us managers at unofficialmspafans about it, and at some point mentioned that a few pieces of track art weren't attached to any song any more, and that it was too late to have the songs replaced. Which is a shame, because the piece of track art I saw (this one, in fact) was very good! So, I spent the next week or so making a song in the style of a certain French nu disco duo (no prizes for guessing who) out of elements from [[Rust Servant]] and [[track:fuchsia-ruler]], a subtle nod to [[Eternity Served Cold]], and an even subtler nod to WMM's unofficial remake of Rust Servant, [[Rust Apocalypse]]. For how quickly I made this track, I think it turned out rather well!
    <i>Elanor Pam:</i>
    The battle between the Condesce and the Handmaid is still one of the most mysterious parts of the story, and I feel its impact and consequences have yet to be fully explored. There's no question that it was an insidious trap for the Condesce, but what is the true nature of the curse spoken by Doc Scratch...?

    <i>Sara Stebbins:</i>
    This piece is written about the Handmaid's struggle against the Condesce, her ultimate defeat, and a sort of butter-tinged relief she feels from it. I wrote parts of this piece in twelve-tone, alluding to the twelve zodiac signs and the twelve numbers on a clock. I tried to keep this piece as simple as I could because I feel that the Handmaid has this silent, brooding austerity with a sense of anger within, which I tried to bring out in occasional dissonance.
    <i>Sigourney Martin:</i>
    So right away this song made me feel /really/ sad. For Handmaid I mean. She needs hugs. But yeah, this song really makes me hear and or see her pain and I suppose relief from just being away from Lord English's grasp. The jerk.

    <i>Rebecca Peason:</i>
    I didn't even realize how little we know about these characters outside of the tragedy in their stories. Putting together an image that had to do with the good times was interesting. I tried to keep the window pane motif as the last two discs, but I thught it departed enough from the first two discs which dealt with what happened in canon and their known stories. I wanted to make it feel like something more readable than the rose windows, like it's own little story.

    I made this once and then realized it sort of sounded like a song for clowns, and then I didn't sleep well the next few nights because at the time I was scared of clowns and thought they were influencing me subliminally.
    There's a beeping section in the middle, except it's actually bad morse code, and it spells out 'no homo.' I don't have an explanation for this.
    <i>YoItsCro:</i>
    This song is called Purple and Purple. Might as well have a focus of purple in the piece, and purple with a meaning at that! Chucklevoodoos always feels like some kind of signature sign with the Makara line. Not only that, but it leaves a sense of unease. Overall, the song gave an ominous feel to me where surrounding the Grand High Blood in an atmosphere was not only complimenting, but fitting! Also, bood on the walls for that extra touch. It's safe to say that the picture pays homage to his appearance in the comic, with the stylizing and unique attributes of course!
    Getting that glow was my prime focus, and to also light up and put some focus at that wicked paint of his! They have to be some of the physical characteristics that stand out the most to me, and certainly focal points that I attempted to pull attention towards.

    So I was working on music for an askblog, and it came out particularly Summoner-y! I'm pretty sure the guitar that comes in around 2:05 was something from a Legend of Zelda song I heard once but it seemed to fit a young Mr. Nitram.
    <i>Amanda Bell:</i>
    As the song being inspired by Nitram + Zelda, this color palette and imagery came to fruition. Heavily inspired by Skyward Sword.

    Blue, blue, blue<br>Im seein blue, blue blue<br>A couple hundred years, waiting to run into you<br>Seldom thoughts can hurt me<br>I cant even find my self<br>In the void i wish to linger,<br>Not that i have a choice
    Something here seems to be<br>Always eating at my health<br>Something i cant quite figure<br>Not that i have a voice
    Maybe i pitied you<br>Giddy at the thought of you<br>Maybe my hearts not true<br>To the cause ive devoted my life into
    Perhaps not out of my own volition<br>Stomping out every coalition<br>Regardless of the lives they may have saved<br>I knew to you they only misbehaved
    Maybe it is because<br>Im a glutton for punishment<br>Behind my eyes a buzz,<br>Banishment, admonishment
    Blue, blue, blue<br>Im seeing blue, blue, blue,<br>Somehow im still not free,<br>Finding comfort in my stealth<br>a misery machine, with her<br>No reason to rejoice

    I decided to focus on Darkleer struggling to reconcile his weakness towards two known criminals and how their influence forces him to question his loyalty to the Empress, as well as his role in enforcing her hemocaste system.

    <i>psithurist:</i>
    This is actually the first song I've ever put out with my voice (so go easy, haha). It's a song from the Disciple's perspective about her friends, her oppressors, and herself, and also about her role as a scribe, recording the trials of the ancestors.
    <i>senpai-satan:</i>
    At first i had alot of ideas about what i wanted to draw for image but i finally settled with a view of the disciple writing on the screen while inside a cave, giving a nod towards Nepeta and for example her shipping wall.

    <i>Zan Beaver:</i>
    The minute I saw that I was to make a track for Redglare and Pyralspite, it screamed for harpsichord in a weird key (I honestly don't know the key I wrote this song in). After getting the main instrument to work the song around, I had to imagine their relationship. I described it as trusting, solid, slightly playful yet harsh. So I created a melody to fit this description, and it blossomed from there.
    <i>Gilwing:</i>
    The only time Pyralspite and Redglare are shown together in-comic they're busy raining hellfire on Mindfang's fleet, so I wanted to create a more intimate moment to showcase their relationship. A monstrous and powerful, but loving, dragon mother surrounds and protects her cocky, talented daughter with a dangerous passion for justice. I wanted it to look a bit like an aged photograph, like an old, warm memory, which is something the harpsichord made me think of. As we know, Pyralspite outlived Redglare by quite a lot.

    Them: "we need a dubstep track for our project"<br>Me: "I gotchu fam"
    Thus this master piece was born. If you don't like this song, then you can contact me through the credit links, so I can explain to you why your opinion is objectively wrong.
    <i>Erin B.:</i>
    I wanted to depict Summoner in some context while also capturing the power that the song was radiating. I tried to show a moment of the revolution at the starting clash of a battle. The song also had some calmer moments, which I felt were very appropriate for the moment right before battle. That, and I really wanted to draw Summoner and Pyralspite looking cool.

    <i>Navochao:</i>
    "You cut to the bone, pick up the phone, to hear my swan song"
    The phrase [Swan Song] refers to an ancient belief that swans sing a beautiful song in the moment just before death, having been silent during most of their lifetime.
    <i>gelasticat:</i>
    I wanted something dramatic because that just seemed right for a swan song but somewhat subdued at the same time since that's how the track came across. I went with a stained glass aesthetic because they've always encompassed that kind of feeling for me.

Commentary: |-
    <i>Circlejourney:</i>
    This is a piano arrangement on [[The Doom of the Planets]], an earlier track on the album. Instead of building to a grand orchestral climax, this version dwells more on a sense of foreboding and finality that surrounds the latter part of the Condesce's journey, with the Vast Glub and the extinction of the troll race soon to come.
    The Condesce looks on at a new star system as her ship approaches, mirroring the contemplative mood of the track.

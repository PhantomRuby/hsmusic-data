    <i>Xszelor:</i>
    This album described as one big clowning out some old businesses I started long way into 2021. These works are rabid, hilarious and awkwardly made but may it be the true Highblood? May it be.

Lyrics: |-
    To keep a pace you keep an eye
    You see these faces upon a sides
    To corner reach upon the cry
    Better rest should I
    I have wrist that crumbles down my eye

    The something from the space
    Something out of the all grace
    The something of that hulk and compencade
    The answers of our race

    The Jugglanoids had came to earth
    For greater lies
    They are marching down for you
    They howling after raids of can tombs
    There armies of the better armed, impossible to reach
    They stalk the night
    And nowhere you can breach

    Jugglanoids from outer space
    They coming after, nothing onto grace
    Jugglanoids from outer space
    They coming toward, coming out for grace
    Jugglanoid from outer space
    Is coming after, and not for grace
    Jugglanoids from outer space
    They coming after, after onto grace
    Jugglanoids from outer space
    They coming towards, not for grace
    They coming towards, not for grace

Lyrics: |-
    Once was the possible way to be
    Once was the art of the far to see
    Once was the culture, once was
    Once was the fuel to your nightmares

    By my name, in my game, so long can be
    By my way onto pain, for you to see
    By my way onto pain, for you to see

    Aw shit, man, that's ICP
    This is my jam
    They were my-

    Hard so I need a mate
    So my homeboy's cousin set me up with a blind date
    She said, "Pick me up at 3?"
    "Can't bitch, the bus don't ride ya street!" (Ho)
    We gonna eat at Mexican Village
    Take a cab and I'll pay the tab
    And when she showed up, well I'll be damned
    Left my wallet at home on the TV stand
    ("Oh shit, well I uh left it at home, it's on the TV stand...")
    Have her payin' and for dinner too (too)

    Slipped me a fifty
    "Violent J's kinda nifty"
    If I'd of hit it, you'd of been home-

Lyrics: |-
    Nor for the gates near the gaze i afford the way
    I afford the suffering
    Our need are insane, and insane is a lot wrong term taste
    We can go and try
    Or the day i die
    Our caress
    And a smell of piss

    Pileing on the bodies of the ones i havent seen before
    We ravage the rallies and go smacking down your door
    We had all enough of this affirated than before
    Somwere close to faygo bottle you succumbed to piss into
    Pileing on the bodies of the ones i havent seen before
    We are known to race beneath the tables catching bits on floor
    We are known relentless visiting this one convinience store
    We are getting seen denyiers of the taste that was before

    Let me to let go
    To make this
    I will order
    And buy
    Before
    To go resign
    And i will order
    The Double Faygo

    I will drink the double faygo it will go completely floss
    And betrust my double faygo to my brother Honking Christ
    I will drink the double faygo analyzing in my mind
    I will dreink the double faygo and believe that wouldn't died

    Pileing on the bodies of the ones i havent seen before
    We ravage the rallies and go smacking down your door
    We had all enough of this affirated than before
    Somwere close to faygo bottle you succumbed to piss into
    Pileing on the bodies of the ones i havent seen before
    We are known to race beneath the tables catching bits on floor
    We are known relentless visiting this one convinience store
    We are getting seen denyiers of the taste that was before
    We are getting seen denyiers of the taste that was before

Lyrics: |-
    Wail Juggla, Wail on the Juggla
    They smuggled, taste another
    They smuggled, taste another
    They smuggled, taste another
    They smuggled, taste another

    I can be born, but i cant get old
    Way before, that all the crops was growing
    And for past behind, i remember the odor
    Driving me mad, so yes it, the truth unfolded

    I see the play that it was, inside my vicious eyes
    This world this world this world, after god dismayed himself
    I have to die with moisture down inside my pants
    But i believed That Clown was coming here unarmed

    Wail Juggla, Wail on the Juggla
    They smuggled, taste another
    They smuggled, taste another

    "Police reports a violent attack over the Faygo bottle, patrol states that a strange customer attacked the manager, both death in violent shootout, such a demonic crime, with what force-"

Lyrics: |-
    I have no word to describe this, catastrophic scene, i seen
    They ran out of paint, till this day, they had not ordered more
    They ran out of paint, to this day, they not, did not
    I seen thousands tons of paint but they sold it with a malice
    I should end it all for good so i take their own distide

    I sentence less to say, i try this more to play
    This so defining less the meaning mor to interway
    I raise my flag, to track the job fast
    To make more then 3$ an decease

    For you, who listens this
    For you the only
    I want you to follow my instructions
    Please stop and get a job
    And buy all, all face paint sellers in your city, state, country.
    Thats how we win.

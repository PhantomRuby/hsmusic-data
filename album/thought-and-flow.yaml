    The first time I composed with an actual instrument, but not performed; in fact I'll never do that for the duration of this project, but maybe next year's.

    Nothing too special, just some simple thinking music. Pick a train of thought and follow it while this song does its work.

    I didn't mean to add this track, but it just sounded so nice when I started working, I got in a different flow.

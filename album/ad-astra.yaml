    <i>Ducky Senpai:</i> ([Bandcamp about blurb](https://duckysenpai.bandcamp.com/album/ad-astra))
    4 primary tracks from [[album:the-planets]] entirely revisited, revamped, and remixed for an EDM audience. Less experimental, more electronica.

    The content of this album--while inspired by Homestuck to an extent--is not affiliated with or derivative of Andrew Hussie, Homestuck affiliates, or anyone who doesn't go by the name "Ducky."

    Now downloadable for free!

    Ad Astra is out!

    I'm finally releasing my latest (and probably last) Homestuck-inspired album.

    This album contains 4 primary tracks originally from [[album:the-planets]] and another [[track:stargazer-ad-astra|"bonus" intro track]] as well. These songs have been remixed and remastered with a more focused mind for an EDM audience.

    If you liked The Planets, I'm sure you'll <i>really</i> like Ad Astra.

    This is a compilation of tracks mostly from [[album:hiveswap-friendsim]], available on various streaming platforms. Spotify and other platforms indicate the album is dated [[date:December 15, 2018]], but this is just a custom date to match when the Hiveswap Friendsim album released. YouTube dates the album [[date:April 9, 2020]], which we've taken as the date here; [a post on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/homestuck/comments/fyqu3y/some_of_the_hiveswap_friendsim_soundtrack_is_on/) indicates it released at the latest [[date:April 10, 2020]].

    The sixteenth track, [[track:i-guess-i-do-other-stuff-now-too]], was originally published as "Yall Know I Just Do the Music Right". And then James Roach started [doing other stuff!](https://beyondcanon.com/credits)

    The bonus track [[track:yeah-it-is-collection]] predates [[track:yeah-it-is-soundtrack|its inclusion]] on [[album:pesterquest-soundtrack]], making it this track's earliest generally available release, though it was first published as part of [[flash:pq-vol8|Pesterquest's eighth volume]] and as a track [on SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/jamesroachmusic/pesterquest-aradias-theme-yeah-it-is) (as other Pesterquest tracks were, around the time).

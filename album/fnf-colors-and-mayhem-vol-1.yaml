    i feel super proud of this one just cause it plays with the storytelling aspect of fnf songs that i enjoy. cute lil progression between the life stages of aradia as bf tries to get a hold on his canon-traversal powers. Originally there was gonna be a god-tier section if you got a good enough accuracy.

    Rather than Rock Lobster, the original reference given was ["Iraq Lobster"](https://youtu.be/2ZxdOeXUiJ0) from Family Guy. Do with that information what you wish.

    My personal favorite. The song is sorta similar to a Twilight Sparkle song i made for Funkin Is Magic. Anywho i tried to pull of a 'guy who tries to be a smart ass leader but has anger issues and is weird' and i think i nailed the vibe. also the neat [[Terezi Owns]] motif when terezi owns the mic ;PPP and [[media:misc/archive/FUCKASS (first iteration).flac|the first ever iteration]] didn't even have terezi. not even like a section of the song was replaced it was just the entire terezi part not there. the song ws gonna be like oen minute 50 seconds what??? so i shoved the T gal in there to steal the spotlight (and mic).

    i first started this song based on [Doja Cat - I Don't Do Drugs (Y2K Remix)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rux8fJQ3ia8). and shoved in a bunch of cat shit like Anamanaguchi's [[Meow]] sample and [[track:im-a-cat-now|that cat song i kept hearing on tiktok]]. the Jersey club beat was actually was an addition after [[media:misc/archive/meowrail (first iteration).flac|the first iteration]] of the song. A lot of the song's backing melodies are based on an old song i wrote that i had no idea what to do with called [[media:misc/archive/IMISSU.flac|IMISSU]]

    weirdly enough Kanaya's song was also based on [Doja Cat - I Don't Do Drugs (Y2K Remix)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rux8fJQ3ia8) but i think i did a better job at capturing it. Kanaya's chromatic voice samples had to be resampled like 3 times cause [[media:misc/archive/Troll Fashion (first iteration).flac|the first iteration]] soudned to nasly and [[media:misc/archive/Troll Fashion (second iteration).flac|the 2nd]] lacked variety in the vowels. you can kinda hear the old voice in the spotify release of [[track:collide-colors-mayhem-vol-1|Collide]]

    This was the first main song i made for C&M. I think i was playing around with a music box VST on FL Studio and suddenly got inspired to make a terezi song. aroudn the middle part where it goes all epic, i imagine like a cute [s] page looking sequence

    This is actually my 4th attempt at making a Vriska song for FNFCM. [[media:misc/archive/Amen 8r8k (first iteration).flac|The first iteration]] was called Amen 8r8k so you can imagine how that sounded like. I think a lot of times i just repurposed old unreleased songs and try to shove vriska in it. [[media:misc/archive/Luck8r8ker (second iteration).flac|The second iteration]] was called Luck8r8ker but again it was just vriska voice slapped on an instrumental of a remix of [Abjure](https://youtu.be/eK0hKrURCIc) from Sburban Showtime

    <i>bb-panzu:</i>

    There IS a reason this song's name is so inconsistant between releases and thats cause of Equius's typing quirk. i couldn't put % on spotify so i had to change it to STRONG bound instead of %(Cross)mound. The song was def based on sigmachad shit i heard on tiktok. so all that phonk shit and whatever genre Deku The -Ilante videos were. this song actually shares the same chord progression as [[track:meowrail|meowrail]]

    if im being honest this is my least favorite only cause it was a pain to sample crappy 2013 mobile phone quality voice clips to a pitchable format. so eridan's voice sounds kinda gnaggly. But i dig the inst. if i had the chance i would definately make it feel for rounded out. I was originally gonna call this song 'Troll Fascist' because Eridan being hemophobic and all and to constrant the song [[track:troll-fashion|'Troll Fashion']] but i prioritzed the quirk and plus ehhhhh yea yk yea

    a classic. my magnum opus in the Homestuck community priot to [Doritos and Fritos](https://youtu.be/ew_EEQWnsto). I remember making this song the day after reading that pesterlog. i want ed to creat a song that had that 'bgm' esc vibe to it but not super 'retro and 8 bit woagg' yknow. i remember making it having a bunch of instrumental elements that it ended up drowing out the voices so i had to learn how to be economic with my instruments and mixing. it was my first ever published homestuck fnf thing and i remember [[artist:yoitscro|YoItsCro]] geeking about it and how proud they were of my transition to a homestuck

    <i>bb-panzu:</i>

    this song imo doesn't hold up as well as i think it could. the bass is fire tho and it was my first ever use of MODO Bass VST after the Ample Bass plugin kept doing the weird sound glitch (iykyk). and no the [Bad Romance](https://youtu.be/qrO4YZeyl0I) motif was not intentional. First song i had to push my voice acting skills for cause i couldn't afford to get voice actors to say my super specififc lines with many retakes so i learned how to enhance my range.

    THE john song. it's him fighting those 2 big goblin thingies + his grandma assist. i made sure to really stick with the limitations of the nes when making this chiptune song

    The [[track:megalovania-ebhh|Megalovania]] reference listed is actually the Megalovania melody played in reverse.

    One day me and some friends were on a discord call and he had his voicemod vocoder on and it started vocoding his air conditioner. we joked about sampling it to a song and i did. and then i ended up making a Doc Scratch song ft. Damara. Damara's voice is just sampled from Jolyne since thats my headcanon and all :333. the song was gonna have Andrew Hussie in it but i think i just had to put something out so i did. if i were to make something with this again i'd add in the hussie voices

    <i>Quarl:</i> (composer, [YouTube description](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_5iWAHbjMA), excerpt)

    This song comes off my recent "Exposure" release. You can buy it on Amazon/iTunes, or you could listen to it here for free :P

    ([dead MySpace link](https://myspace.com/quarldnb))

    EDIT: It's 2021 now and I can't believe this linked to a myspace page. Have a recent ["remaster"](https://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/997824) download, free.

    <i>Quarl:</i> (composer, [Newgrounds remaster description](https://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/997824), excerpt)

    Yet another remaster nobody asked for. Originally written circa 2008, I took this down at some point because I thought I was going to be rich and famous or some shit. Not a single label wanted this however. As a result this was reuploaded at some point but then I took it down again after somebody used it in a <b>really shitty hentai game</b> circa 2010. Truth be told, I'm far more mature now and would be honored if somebody used this in their shitty hentai game. No really, go for it. I'll even provide the <b><i>sex noises</i></b> if you <b>ask nicely.</b> ([dead Shopify image link](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0265/3475/products/3295_largeview_06d4bdc2-ed06-4061-b87f-9ceca33ca248.jpeg?v=1475254019))

    The original 2008 rsn file was so much fun to look at. I'm surprised there was even a back up after crashing my PC so many times. I've lost plenty of other song files over the years. It was surprisingly clean to look at. Added some new sounds to this version but I didn't want to over do it. This track was good enough as it was when it was written. Mostly just boosting levels and adding some fidelity. Opted to keep that subby bass intro, sorry if you listen in on lofi speakers and can't pick up that bass.

    Over the decades I've come to accept for obscurity as an artist but this track will always have a special place in my spleen. I hope that it may one day gain a special place in your spleen too.

    Album of Stories and Imagination is a homestuck-inspired album made by me (Latadenata).

    This album was made for a roleplaying group of friends that are currently playing a custom SBURB game session with their original characters (that you can see on the cover art for the album!)

    Each song was made to represent important moments of the story and their characters, such as character themes, bossfights, land themes... Just so the roleplay would be even more epic. And because I really like making music. Even more if it's homestuck-themed music.

    The cover art of the album is heavily inspired by the cover for the homestuck album [[album:coloUrs-and-mayhem-universe-a|Colours and Mayhem Universe A]] & [[album:coloUrs-and-mayhem-universe-b|B]], made originally by the amazing artist [[artist:shelby-cragg|Shelby Cragg]]. This cover art, however, was made by our amazing Delsito which you can support on twitter: https://twitter.com/Delsote_

Lyrics: |-
    Humanity rejected
    Achieving perfection

    One, two, three, OBJECTIVE
    Three, two, one, TERMINATED

    Humanity rejected
    Achieving perfection

    Achieving perfection
    Must lose
    Humanity

    Nature it's flawed at its core
    Living beings can be something more
    Artificial Life designed to be perfect

    You must allow us to resurrect it
    Our broken world
    Full of useless emotions
    It's on your hands
    To comply our demands

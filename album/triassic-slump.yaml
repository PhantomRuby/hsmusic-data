Lyrics: |-
    there's a washing machine deep inside your heart
    and that's where all the dinosaurs live
    their diet is mostly vegetarian but some of them
    well, some of them branch out a bit

    these are the carnivores inside you
    who are eating you piece by piece, every day of your life
    these are the carnivores living inside you
    who have never paid a single cent of rent

    WHEN TYRANNY SOARS OVER US
    WRECKS OUR LIVES, IT'S OVER FOR US
    I'M SICK TO DEATH OF THESE DINOSAURS
    THESE GODDAMN TYRANNASAURS

    despite eating as much as they possibly can
    these dinosaurs are never satisfied
    their entire existence is dedicated to this
    eternal consumption

    they are very inconsiderate tenants
    in all manner of speaking, to be quite honest
    if they had their way they'd be eating you up
    until there's absolutely nothing left of you

    I WANT TO TAKE THESE HANDS AND THIS HEAD
    I WANT TO PUT THEM ALL IN ONE ROW
    I'LL MAKE THE DINOSAUR SANDWICH OF THEIR GREAT BED
    BREAK THE COCONUT OPEN AND GIVE THEM A SHOW

    I CAN FEEL THEM BITING ON THEIR LITTLE CRUSADE
    THEY'RE ALWAYS BITING, ALWAYS ON OVERDRIVE
    IT'S NOT A MISTAKE FOR YOU TO BE AFRAID
    IT'S NOT A MISTAKE FOR YOU TO BE ALIVE

    (make way, and welcome the t-rex inside your heart)

Lyrics: |-
    if you don't mind
    just a moment of your time
    to reminisce
    on the moments you might have missed

    collection true
    all it's true just to you
    you're not thinking enough
    of what's all the right stuff

    MAJOR MOTION PICTURE
    YEAH YOU'RE ONE SICK CREATURE
    CLASSIC FULL LENGTH FEATURE
    SIT BACK, RELAX AND FEEL

    it's not enough
    going on with this bluff
    did you really think
    you were anything anymore

    so just sit back
    at this screening of your past
    oh you simple tool
    you were always the fool

    dinosaurs driving to the theater!
    dinosaurs buying tickets!
    dinosaurs spilling popcorn!
    dinosaurs having a wonderful time!
    dinosaurs pointing and clapping!
    dinosaurs always laughing!
    dinosaurs are always there!
    dinosaurs are always there!

Lyrics: |-
    gotta keep the boogie going [repeated]

    there's a man there with a gun
    standing there with his entourage
    it doesn't matter where I go
    there's always a man with a gun

    the man tells me he's a close friend
    he says this as he points his gun at me
    now you better start to dance
    or you'll find this to be the end

    gotta keep the boogie going [repeated]

    KEEP AN EYE ON YOUR GROCERY LIST
    AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVEN'T MISSED
    THE POWDER, THAT YOU'LL FIND BETWEEN YOUR EYES
    AND FIND IT ALL INSIDE

    IT'S NOT A MATTER OF WHAT I THINK
    IS RIGHT OR WRONG OR WHAT I THINK IS
    ALL I KNOW, ALL I FEEL
    IT'S HOW I FEEL ALL THE TIME

    gotta keep it going [repeated]
    gotta keep it, keep the boogie
    going, going

Lyrics: |-
    I knew an old guy who said true love is death (deaf?)
    at the time I thought I misheard
    but then he told me that pain will never mend
    then he started shouting many dirty words

    so I laughed him off "AREN'T YOU HAVING FUN"
    but then I started getting scared that I would be like him
    dumb enough to think that you would really fit
    but all I really found was the worst it's ever been

    *escape into reality*
    *with a common causality*
    *except for banality*
    *and extreme inhospitality*

    *and the squirrel knew everything*
    *except for what they didn't which was everything*
    *and that's the problem see*
    *but it doesn't matter, because*

    [chorus]
    RABBIT AND SQUIRREL DON'T TALK ANYMORE
    RABBIT AND SQUIRREL DON'T TALK ANYMORE
    RABBIT AND SQUIRREL DON'T TALK ANYMORE
    RABBIT AND SQUIRREL ARE BROKE EVERMORE

    "if there's any ever any problem then that's something I can fix"
    said the rabbit to the squirrel, what a fool
    you try fixing anything when getting pulled into a fix
    of mass insecurity and a fear cesspool

    now rabbit's sitting here with nothing really gained
    except for knowledge that all people are really turds
    they'll latch onto you in hopes they'll be saved
    but when they ever are? the answer is never

    *you didn't want just anyone*
    *but you really wanted anyone*
    *so you latched onto the one*
    *who you already had won*

    *now you got a pick-me-up*
    *that you're sure you can't mess up*
    *but it doesn't feel quite right*
    *the relationship isn't tight*

    *all can be repaired*
    *but your partner is impaired so*
    *make sure you declare for*
    *them to be prepared that*

    *they must really change but*
    *no one can really change so*
    *you get really mad*
    *but it doesn't matter because*

    [chorus]

    (now I'm singing words I know you'll never hear)
    (now I'm singing words I hope you'll never hear)
    (but at least I know I'm free of all the lies)
    (but at least I know I'm free of all the time)

    (tell me, was I a good goldfish?)
    (hope I was, you piece of shi-

    *rabbit was in love with squirrel*
    *but squirrel was in love with love*

    rabbit and squirrel don't talk anymore
    rabbit and squirrel don't talk anymore
    rabbit and squirrel don't talk anymore
    rabbit and squirrel are broke evermore
    rabbit and squirrel don't talk anymore
    rabbit and squirrel don't talk anymore
    rabbit and squirrel don't talk anymore
    rabbit and squirrel don't talk

    (and I'll never let it happen again, no)
    (never let it happen again)
    (and I'll never let it happen again, no)
    (never let it happen again)

Lyrics: |-
    let the door hit me on the way out
    an embarrassment but without a shout
    never found the answers, not a hunch
    guess I'm lucky I held onto my lunch

    1. look deep inside
    2. find hidden key
    3. open the gate
    4. see all them there
    5. sick dinosaurs
    6. sick in the mind
    7. sick twisted thoughts
    8. nobody cares
    9. only one way
    10. to bridge the tide
    11. of great despair
    12. and homicide
    13. now you must laugh
    14. now you must laugh
    15. now you must laugh
    16. now you must

Lyrics: |-
    I don't like the look of people
    they seem so strange to me
    so many drifting limbs and
    so much harmony

    they make me feel so nervous
    and I know I should leave
    to run away forever
    ah

    a place to hide away now
    that's just the thing I need
    to lock away the key to
    endless fleeting dreams

    I don't need to look around
    if I can close my eyes
    and turn my skin deaf and
    blind to its disguise

    but thank god the mirror is still fogged up today
    fogged up today
    yeah thank god the mirror is still fogged up today
    fogged up today

    but I'm still me

    so you think you're all alone
    on this journey towards forever and a half
    so you think you're all washed up
    with nothing to do for any evermore

    well I've got the answer for you
    it's all up in here
    well I've got the answer for you
    when dinosaurs break down your door

    IT'S JUST A DAILY ROUTINE
    CAN'T YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN

Lyrics: |-
    close the door behind you when you leave
    I can worry about myself
    pulling up the covers to see
    look at all this endless boundless wealth

    I can see someone in the bed
    I can see me but it's not me
    there's a sack of meat right there
    moving its arms all around

    CUZ I'M NOT REAL
    I'M NOT REAL
    OH NO
    OH NO

    it's not like anything's wrong (there's something wrong)
    it's not like anything's wrong (there's something wrong)
    the wind still blows (the wind blows)
    that's how I know (there's something wrong)

    it's not like anything's wrong (there's something wrong)
    it's not like anything's wrong (there's something wrong)
    it's not like anything's wrong (there's something wrong)
    I swear there's nothing wrong (you're lying)

    ooooh

    and I think I want to die alone
    and I think I want to die alone
    and I think I want to die alone, alone
    and I think I want to die alone

Lyrics: |-
    I've got a question for you
    do you really believe
    we'll ever get through

    I share the same mind
    with someone who's lost
    their own sense of time

    I'm so sick of this line (lie?)
    that it'll all be fine
    if you just stick with me

    but I don't wanna lay down
    still wanna stick around
    and see what's there

    I'm gonna get out of bed
    just need 5 minutes more
    to rest

    feels like I'm sleeping more in the afternoon these days
    I'm not really sure that's a good thing
    haven't got the motivation to commit the crime
    ladies and gentlemen of the jury are quite confused

    and everyone is crying and laughing
    and everyone is holding ha-
    and everyone is all together
    in the darkest times of their li-i-i-i

    and the t rex keeps laughing
    and the t rex keeps laughing
    and the t rex keeps laughing
    and the t rex keeps laughing

    WELL IT LOOKS LIKE TYRANNY IS FINALLY GOING TO SOAR
    SOAR TYRANNY, WRECK THEIR LIVES!

    ooooooooh

    (and now I understand, true love is death)

    LET THE METEORS COME DOWN [repeated]

    come down from there
    you'll see it's not so bad
    you've got friends and the like who all love you a lot
    and if you don't I'm sure there's some hanging around

    caught in between but nothing's as it seems
    it's okay, you're alright
    you're alright

    goodbye dinosaur my poor-weather friend
    there's no doubt in my heart that I'll see you again

    farewell pterosaur
    goodbye stegosaurus
    t-rex, it's been nice
    but it's time for you to leave

    (for the book must close)
    (as we shutter the blinds)
    (for everything must end)
    (with the passing of time)

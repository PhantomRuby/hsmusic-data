Lyrics: |-
    Welcome, welcome, come one and all
    Our twinkling lights begin to call
    The gates are opening to a fabulous place
    So grab your ticket and paint a smile on your face

    Trolls are trapezing, the MC is scheming
    The Faygo's on tap, the wheel sends you dreaming

    This is the Dark Carnival!
    Once you enter the tent, a mind-bending event
    This is the Dark Carnival!
    You'll learn to call this place your home

    Try the deep-fried grubs and the grub-fried scrubs
    I work here for life 'cause everyone does

    This is the Dark Carnival!
    Cast like stars in the skies, you won't believe your eyes
    At the Dark Carnival!
    You'll have to call this place your home
    I know I call this place my home

Lyrics: |-
    (Woo! Yeah! Haha! Alright! Wooh! Hey, yeah! haha, yeah! Woo!)

    You can see me on the stage, you can hear me in your dreams (Get the dreams)
    You can find me on your screen, you can feel me in your feed (F-f-feed)

    You got this toxic love (Woah, woah)
    You want me for my blood (Woah, woah)
    Wearing me like a glove (Woah, woah)
    You need me right where you can see me

    You got your hands around my heart and it's starting to come apart
    Numb my brain with fizzy drinks, nurse the pain with sneaky links
    My mind and lines will break the twine that binds
    But you told me to ignore what homies think
    Got me riding in the ring
    Eating like a king
    Right under your wing
    Tell me what to sing
    Interchange a swing
    Took my mind right to the brink
    Solving riddles like the Sphinx
    All I know is that your toxic love stinks (Wooh!)

    You know it in your heart, you can hear it in my screams (Sc-sc-screams, screams, woah-oh)
    You know I need to leave, take me out of this routine (T-t-tine, tine)

    You got this toxic love (Woah, woah)
    You want me for my blood (Woah, woah)
    Wearing me like a glove (Woah-oah!)
    You need me right where you can see me

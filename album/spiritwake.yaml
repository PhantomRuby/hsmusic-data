    The soundtrack for the upcoming iOS video game!

    Spiritwake, which was written over the span of late October 2011 to late February 2012, is my second foray into trying out orchestral instruments, and shows how significantly I’ve improved since [[album:prospit-and-derse|Prospit & Derse]].

    Spiritwake’s setting is a post-apocalyptic world centered around spirits and magic, and takes a heavy influence from ethnic cultures, especially Native American. For this album, I chose to follow that path, but with my interpretation and interest in ethnic music infused in there, including West African influenced drums, string section melodies distantly inspired by traditional East Asian music, and an atmosphere that reminds me of both Celtic music and Native American.

    On top of that is the instrument selection ranging from modern symphonic orchestral to organic synths to traditional winds and metals, which when combined created a really fantastic texture in the sound.

    Needless to say, this is by far the best composition work I’ve ever done, and I am absolutely thrilled that you are taking the time to enjoy it.

    Who knows where I’ll go from here, eh? It’s exciting.

    All of the track art and track commentary for this album has been taken from the SoundCloud uploads of the tracks. The commentary is talking about earlier versions of the tracks so some (Specifically [[track:distant-memories|Distant Memories]]) may be a bit outdated.

    The game this album was intended to be a soundtrack to seemingly never materialized.

    Yet another song from the same game as [[track:the-last-seeker|The Last Seeker]] and [[track:frozen-souls|Frozen Souls]]. This one's got a strong string arrangement going throughout most of it. Hope you enjoy!

    Another song from the upcoming iOS (and eventually Android) game, Spiritwake! This one has a bit of an electronic sound to it, reflecting a lost society.

    I think I need to tweak the lead at the end of the song, though... hah.
